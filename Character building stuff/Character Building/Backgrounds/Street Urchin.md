# Street Urchin
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-background.svg|150]]

You eked out a living by picking pockets on the streets of a major city, never knowing where you'd find your next meal. While some adventure for the glory, you do so to survive.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Dexterity** or **Constitution**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Thievery skill and a Lore skill for the city you lived in as a street urchin (such as Absalom Lore or Magnimar Lore). You gain the [[Pickpocket]] skill feat.
