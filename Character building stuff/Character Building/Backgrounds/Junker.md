# Junker
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-background.svg|150]]

You live on the outskirts of civilization, combing through the detritus left behind for interesting trinkets to sell or use in your own crafting. Though you have a preferred terrain to search, you know that the greatest treasures occur where people make greater use of technology.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Strength** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the Athletics skill and the Lore skill of the terrain in which you scavenge. You gain the [[Hefty Hauler]] skill feat.
