**Prerequisite** Region - Golden Road

* * *

Whether in Katapesh or one of the bustling markets along the Path of Salt, you've spent enough time buying and selling ancient or unusual items to give you an instinctive ability to quickly sort valuable trinkets from worthless baubles.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Intelligence** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the Arcana skill and the Mercantile Lore skill. You gain the [[Quick Identification]] skill feat.
