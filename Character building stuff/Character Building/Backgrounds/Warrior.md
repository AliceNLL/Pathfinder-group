# Warrior
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-background.svg|150]]

In your younger days, you waded into battle as a mercenary, a warrior defending a nomadic people, or a member of a militia or army. You might have wanted to break away from the regimented structure of these forces, or you could have always been as independent a warrior as you are now.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Strength** or **Constitution**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Intimidation skill and the Warfare Lore skill. You gain the [[Intimidating Glare]] skill feat.
