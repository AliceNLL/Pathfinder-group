# Feral Child
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-background.svg|150]]

You spent your youth in the wilderness, living close to or perhaps raised by animals. You have a close, mystical connection with these animals and gained certain abilities from them, though this limited your well-roundedness in mental pursuits.

Choose one ability boost. It must be **Strength**, **Dexterity**, or **Constitution**.

You are trained in Nature and Survival. You gain [[Low-Light Vision]] (or [[Darkvision]] if you already had Low-Light Vision), imprecise scent with a range of 30 feet, and the [[Forager]] skill feat.
