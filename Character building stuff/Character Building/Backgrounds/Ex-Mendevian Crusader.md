# Ex-Mendevian Crusader
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-background.svg|150]]

When the Great Quake rumbled across the eastern lands and opened the rift that southerners called "the Worldwound," you answered the call to arms to fight back the demonic hordes. What you saw during the war changed you forever-so much so that you became a wanderer, hermit, or other voluntary outcast. When you came upon the Broken Tusk following, you determined you'd finally found a people whose values and traditions made you feel whole again. The Broken Tusk was supposedly once a much bigger following, and so you've joined them in the hopes of helping them heal old wounds and rebuild in the shadow of loss. In the process, perhaps this new family will help you do the same.
