# Hunter
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-background.svg|150]]

You stalked and took down animals and other creatures of the wild. Skinning animals, harvesting their flesh, and cooking them were also part of your training, all of which can give you useful resources while you adventure.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Dexterity** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Survival skill and the Tanning Lore skill. You gain the [[Survey Wildlife]] skill feat.
