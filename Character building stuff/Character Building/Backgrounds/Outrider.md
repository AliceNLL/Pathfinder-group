# Outrider
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-background.svg|150]]

In your youth, you galloped on horseback over vast prairies, serving as a vanguard for your settlement, an army, or another group. Seeing so many different lands built a thirst in you to adventure and explore the world instead of just racing past it.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the Nature skill and the Plains Lore skill. You gain the [[Express Rider]] skill feat.
