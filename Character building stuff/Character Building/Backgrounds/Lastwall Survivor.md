**Prerequisite** Region - Eye of Dread

You managed to escape the devastation that the Whispering Tyrant brought to your nation, but you lost everything to the lich-king's minions, including your home and many friends and family.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the Medicine skill and the Undead Lore skill. You gain the [[Battle Medicine]] skill feat.
