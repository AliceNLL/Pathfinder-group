# Nexian Mystic
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-background.svg|150]]

**Prerequisite** Region - Impossible Lands

* * *

Your initiations into the Nexian mysteries and the philosophies of the Arclords of Nex grant you a preternatural comprehension of the arcane underpinnings of existence.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Intelligence** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the Arcana skill and a Lore skill related to one plane of your choice (other than the Material Plane). You gain the [[Arcane Sense]] skill feat.
