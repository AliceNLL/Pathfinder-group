# Legendary Parents
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-background.svg|150]]

**\[Legacy - Age of Ashes\]**

One or more of your parents (either biological or adoptive) were heroes of the Age of Ashes Adventure Path. Others tend to treat you with a bit more respect, or perhaps fear your connections to people of great power.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Dexterity** or **Charisma**, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the Intimidation skill, and the Genealogy Lore skill. You gain the [[Group Coercion]] skill feat.
