# Northridge Scholar
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-background.svg|150]]

The political faction of Northridge is focused on modern pragmatism and urban growth. While there are certainly those in this faction who regard those of Southshore as rubes, bumbling yokels, or stubborn traditionalists who would prefer Willowshore never grow, most of those following this local faction instead put their energy into developing Willowshore, envisioning a time when the town might grow into an important hub for trade. Your interests lie more along the concept of Willowshore as a place for learning—a school, library, or even small university could do so much for your town! Of course, as invigorating as it is to study and learn, you also understand that expanding Willowshore in such a way will require lots of hard work, and your childhood helping to lay foundations or raise buildings has given you a physique that eludes the typical scholar.

Your home is likely somewhere along the northern banks of the Ceiba River to the east of downtown Willowshore.

During the Reenactment Festival, you likely helped to run some of the festivities or spent time simply sitting back to people-watch. You volunteered to be an abductee during the Reenactment Festival because the experience of taking part in one of the town's longest-running traditions is an honor you've always wanted to experience.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Strength**, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the Society skill and the Academia Lore skill. You gain the [[Additional Lore]] feat.



* * *

You can add one of the following two adjustments to any background to further modify your choice to match your vision for your PC.

**Family:** You and one (or more) other PCs are close family members (siblings, parent/child, married, etc.) If you take this adjustment, the other PC(s) who are your family must also take this adjustment. Choose one of the following to replace the skill feat you otherwise would've gained from your background. (You and your sibling need not share the same choice—a sibling who wants to keep their background's skill feat can pick "Typical" from the list.)

*   **Bickering:** You have a long-standing feud with your sibling(s). Whenever your sibling(s) critically fail a significant skill check or attack roll and you witness their failure, you gain a +1 status bonus to your saving throws until the end of your next turn as you secretly (or perhaps not so secretly) delight in their failure. 
*   **Close-Knit:** You and your sibling(s) work well together, and you go all-out to help them when they're badly hurt. When you provide [[Aid]] or [[Administer First Aid]] to your sibling(s), the DC is 5 lower than normal.
*   **Typical:** You have a standard relationship with your sibling(s); don't change your background's skill feat.

**Foundling:** You aren't a native to Willowshore, but you did grow up in the town. You might have adoptive parents, or you could've grown up on the streets. Choose one of the following to replace the bonus feat you otherwise would've gained from your background.

*   **Bitter:** You appreciate the town of Willowshore but still resent the conditions that resulted in you being abandoned or left in the town. You gain the [[Intimidating Glare]] skill feat.
*   **Mysterious:** You keep secrets, and very few in Willowshore (if anyone) know your history before you settled in the town, in part because you've taken to learning about Willowshore by watching rather than engaging in conversation. You gain the [[Streetwise]] skill feat.
*   **Outgoing:** You're grateful for the sense of belonging the townsfolk of Willowshore have extended to you and always do your best to repay that kindness. Once per week when you attempt a skill check to resolve a downtime activity that could benefit Willowshore (several of these activities are detailed in the adventures, and your GM can always make the call if another activity would qualify) and you fail that check, you instead succeed at the check, or if you critically fail at that check, you instead simply fail that check.
