# Beast Blessed
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-background.svg|150]]

You once freed a magical beast from captivity and, whether it was intentional or a byproduct of another action, the grateful creature bestowed a blessing of freedom upon you. Your blessing manifests physically, perhaps as elongated canines, fingernails that grow to a sharp point, excess body hair, or some other feature. This physical manifestation is cosmetic and provides no benefit.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Dexterity** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free ability boost.

You are trained in the Survival skill. You gain the [[Bestial Clarity]] reaction.
