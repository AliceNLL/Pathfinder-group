![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-background.svg|150]]

**Prerequisites** Kobold ancestry

You are a digger from the Hookclaw kobold tribe, born beneath the streets of Absalom, with muscles and mind hardened by years spent tunneling through rock and earth and a confidence built upon your pride in your draconic heritage.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Strength** or **Charisma**, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the Crafting skill, the Mining Lore skill, and the Engineering Lore skill. You gain the [[Improvise Tool]] skill feat.
