# Osprey Spellcaster
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-background.svg|150]]

Whether by instinct or study, magic is one of your most notable talents. Your understanding of the traditions of ancient Thassilon has helped you learn languages associated with that nation. Elder Ordwi fears there may be some form of magical affliction spreading in Iron Harbor, and she needs your knowledge to help her determine the threat.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Intelligence** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in your choice of the Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion skill, and gain Thassilonian as a bonus language. You also gain the [[Quick Identification]] skill feat.
