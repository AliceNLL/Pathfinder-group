# Secular Medic
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-background.svg|150]]

**Prerequisite** Region - Golden Road

* * *

You're from Rahadoum, where the Laws of Mortality taught you to reject the gods, yet you've seen firsthand how dangerous it can be to go without healing magic. As a result, you've thrown yourself into the study of medicine, so you can save lives without saving souls.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Wisdom** or **Dexterity**, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the Medicine skill and the Anatomy Lore skill. You gain the [[Battle Medicine]] skill feat.
