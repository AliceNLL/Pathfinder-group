# Shadow Lodge Defector
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-background.svg|150]]

You were among the Pathfinders recruited by the devious Shadow Lodge, lured in by promises of wealth, reform, justice, or revenge. You might have fought against the Society's loyal agents, helped sabotage the Pathfinders' reputation in distant countries, or even infiltrated the far-flung lodges as a spy. You've since made peace with and rejoined the Pathfinder Society, yet the underhanded reflexes and skills you learned are hard to forget.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Dexterity** or **Intelligence**, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the Deception skill and the Underworld Lore skill. You gain the [[Lie to Me|Lie To Me]] skill feat.

**Special** You can select this background only if you have earned credit for at least 5 First Edition scenarios from Season 2 of the Pathfinder Society organized play campaign.
