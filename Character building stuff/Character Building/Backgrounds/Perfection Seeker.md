You aspire to perfect your body and mind in the tradition of Jalmeray's Houses of Perfection, honing your acrobatic skills and mental faculties in preparation for a lifetime pushing the edge of what most consider possible.

You're trained in the Acrobatics skill as well as the Warfare Lore skill. You gain the [[Cat Fall]] skill feat.
