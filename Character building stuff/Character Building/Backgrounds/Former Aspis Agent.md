# Former Aspis Agent
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-background.svg|150]]

For more than a century, the Pathfinder Society has clashed with the avaricious and underhanded Aspis Consortium, and several years ago the Society dealt its rival a decisive blow. You may be one of the few survivors of a doomed Aspis expedition, or perhaps you chafed at the Consortium's villainous practices and defected to the Pathfinders. No matter your reasons, you know how to be efficient and ruthless when the circumstances demand.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Intelligence** or **Charisma**, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the Intimidation skill and the Aspis Consortium Lore skill. You gain the [[Group Coercion]] skill feat. You gain access to any uncommon options as though you were a member of the Aspis Consortium.

**Special** You can select this background only if you have earned credit for at least 5 First Edition scenarios from Season 7 of the Pathfinder Society organized play campaign.
