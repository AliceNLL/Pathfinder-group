# Tomb Born
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-background.svg|150]]

Your parents conceived you for a fell purpose at a site tainted by death, like a wight's barrow, mass grave, or ossuary. Their reasons could be a mystery, or you might know of their grand design and seek to escape-or fulfill-their plans. Either way, you're at your most dangerous when near death.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Dexterity** or **Constitution**, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the Undead Lore skill. You gain the [[Final Spite]] reaction.
