# Dragon Scholar
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-background.svg|150]]

Dragons have fascinated you for as long as you can remember. The potent power they possess, the long lives they lead, the ancient traditions they inspire-whatever the source of your interest, you've spent much of your life to this point immersed in all things draconic. These studies have bolstered your self-confidence and given you a wide range of methods and tactics you can use to impose your will on others.

You've likely chosen to attend the Call for Heroes as a way to seek funds as an adventurer to afford more texts about dragons or perhaps out of a desire to encounter one in real life.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Strength** or **Charisma**, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the Intimidation skill, and the Dragon Lore skill. You gain the [[Intimidating Glare]] skill feat.
