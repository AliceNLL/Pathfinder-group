# Senghor Sailor
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-background.svg|150]]

**Prerequisite** Region - Mwangi Expanse

* * *

As an experienced sailor from Senghor, you know that the only thing saving you from disaster on the high seas is a properly maintained ship. You know boat-building inside and out and you can quickly cobble together a solution in the event that something breaks.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Intelligence** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the Crafting skill and the Sailing Lore skill. You gain the [[Quick Repair]] skill feat.
