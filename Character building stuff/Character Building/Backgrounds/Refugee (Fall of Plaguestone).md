# Refugee (Fall of Plaguestone)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-background.svg|150]]

The fighting around the Lake Encarthan region has forced many of the people residing there to flee from the violence. Although your home is gone, you have managed to survive and are making your way south in search of a better life. When play begins, you are riding along in a caravan taking you to what might be either a new home in Andoran or simply another waypoint in your journey.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Intelligence**, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the Survival skill and the Hunting Lore skill. You gain the [[Forager]] skill feat.
