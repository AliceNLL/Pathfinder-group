Whether you trace your heritage to lost Sarkoris or are a crusader trying to atone for past fanatics' wrongs, you seek to liberate the Sarkorian homeland from the demons who have defiled it.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free boost.

You're trained in the Medicine skill and the Abyssal Lore skill. You gain the [[Battle Medicine]] skill feat.
