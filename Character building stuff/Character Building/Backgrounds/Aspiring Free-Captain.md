**Prerequisite** Region - High Seas

* * *

You seek to join the Free Captains of the Shackles and have learned everything you need to know about sailing and bossing people around. Now you just need a crew and a ship.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Wisdom** or **Charisma**, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the Intimidation skill and the Sailing Lore skill. You gain the [[Group Coercion]] skill feat.
