# Archaeologist
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-background.svg|150]]

You've excavated enough sites to know that ancient civilizations aren't lost; they're merely buried and waiting for the right scholar to unearth them and tell their story. You might have worked as a laborer or local guide before learning formal archaeological techniques.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Intelligence**, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the Society skill and the Architecture Lore skill. You gain the [[Additional Lore]] skill feat related to an ancient culture or the history of a culture you've studied (such as Azlanti Lore or Osirian History Lore).
