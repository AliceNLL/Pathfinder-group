# Runner
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-background.svg|150]]

You served as a messenger for a specific faction, guild, house, or individual, often running those messages on a short timeline. Finding the quickest path from point A to point B is your specialty and you've learned to make the most of your athleticism and navigational skill.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Strength** or **Intelligence**, and one is a free ability boost.

You are trained in the Athletics skill and a Lore skill for the city in which you were a messenger. You gain the Quick Jump skill feat.
