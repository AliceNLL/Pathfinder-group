# Osprey Fisher
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-background.svg|150]]

Fishing is Osprey Cove's number one profession, and you've apprenticed under the best of them: Elder Anlorgog. You're also a keen study of boats and ships, so Elder Ordwi wants you along on her trip to Iron Harbor to help her evaluate the strength and purpose of the village's fleetâ€”particularly if they're building ships meant for war.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Strength** or **Dexterity**, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the Crafting skill and the Sailing Lore skill. You gain the [[Quick Repair]] skill feat.
