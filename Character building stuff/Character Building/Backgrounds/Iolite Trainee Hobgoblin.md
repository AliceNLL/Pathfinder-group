**Prerequisites** Hobgoblin Ancestry

* * *

The Iolite Squad was Oprak's first foray into training hobgoblins for Pathfinder membership. You've added the archival and archaeological skills they sent back to Oprak into your military training.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Intelligence**, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the Society skill and the Warfare Lore skill. You gain the [[Sign Language]] skill feat.
