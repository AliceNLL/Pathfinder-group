**Prerequisites** Kobold Ancestry

* * *

You are one of the Sewer Dragons, born in Absalom's sewers, strengthened by a life defending your territory.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Dexterity** or **Intelligence**, and one is a free ability boost. You're trained in the Crafting skill and the Kobold Lore skill. You gain the [[Snare Crafting]] skill feat.
