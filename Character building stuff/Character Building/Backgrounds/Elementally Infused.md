# Elementally Infused
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-background.svg|150]]

You were exposed to a strong burst of elemental essence originating directly from an elemental plane, most likely caused by a planar breach. Your body absorbed the elemental essence with no ill effects, and now it coalesces within you. With time, you've learned to project elemental power in a manner safe to you but still deadly to others.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Charisma**, and one is a free attribute boost.

Choose one elemental plane: Air, Earth, Fire, Metal, Water, or Wood. You are trained in the corresponding Lore skill: Plane of Air Lore, Plane of Earth Lore, Plane of Fire Lore, Plane of Metal Lore, Plane of Water Lore, or Plane of Wood Lore. You also gain a cantrip according to your chosen plane:

**Air:** _[[Gale Blast]]_

**Earth:** _[[Scatter Scree]]_

**Fire:** _[[Ignition]]_

**Metal:** _[[Needle Darts]]_

**Water:**_[[Spout]]_

**Wood:** _[[Root Reading]]_

You can cast this spell as a primal innate spell at will.
