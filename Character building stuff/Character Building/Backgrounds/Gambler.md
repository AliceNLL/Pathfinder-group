# Gambler
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-background.svg|150]]

The thrill of the win drew you into games of chance. This might have been a lucrative sideline that paled in comparison to the real risks of adventuring, or you might have fallen on hard times due to your gambling and pursued adventuring as a way out of a spiral.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Dexterity** or **Charisma**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Deception skill and the Games Lore skill. You gain the [[Lie to Me|Lie To Me]] skill feat.
