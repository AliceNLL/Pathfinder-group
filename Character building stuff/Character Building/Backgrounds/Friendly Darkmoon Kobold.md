# Friendly Darkmoon Kobold
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-background.svg|150]]

It has taken time, but over the years, you've managed to find a place among the citizens of Falcon's Hollow. While many still distrust kobolds, they at least see you as a fellow villager, if not a friend, and you've got quite the talent for quickly convincing larger groups of people that you mean them no harm.

Choose any two ability boosts. One must be to **Wisdom** or **Charisma**, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the Diplomacy skill and Kobold Lore skill. You gain the [[Group Impression]] skill feat.
