# Finadar Leshy
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-background.svg|150]]

**Prerequisites** Leshy ancestry

* * *

You are a leshy from Finadar Forest, originally created under the corruption of a cyclopean monolith. Though the Pathfinder Society managed to sever the monolith's connection, freeing the forest and your people from its influence, you retain a trace, unnerving connection to the Abyss.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Charisma**, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the Intimidation skill and the Abyssal Lore skill. You gain the [[Intimidating Glare]] skill feat.
