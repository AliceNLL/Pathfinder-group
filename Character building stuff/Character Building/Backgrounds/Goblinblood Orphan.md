**Prerequisite** Region - Old Cheliax

* * *

Your family, whether goblin, hobgoblin, or human, died in the Goblinblood Wars. Though you were marked by these losses, you managed to survive through your own resilience and resourcefulness.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Dexterity** or **Constitution**, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the Survival skill and the Goblin Lore skill. You gain the [[Assurance]] skill feat with Survival.
