# Southbank Traditionalist
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-background.svg|150]]

The political faction of Southbank represents the original founders of Willowshore, a hearty band of settlers whose skills and focus tend toward the earthly and humble. While there are certainly those in this faction who regard Northridge as vapid urbanites, merchants, and power-hungry politicians, most in Southbank devote their energy to helping Willowshore stay fed, honoring its long-standing traditions, and remaining relatively self-sufficient. Your interests in Willowshore's history are closely tied to the traditions of farming and building what you need with your own two hands, as well as taking part in the shared oral history of the region. Whether it's enjoying discussions with local elders about the past or helping newcomers learn Willowshore's ways, you're always eager to help uphold the town's traditions.

Your home is likely located south of the Ceiba River, on the southernmost outskirts of town.

During the Reenactment Festival, you likely spent time helping to set up the feasts, assisted in running some of the events, and otherwise worked behind the scenes. You were chosen to be an abductee during the Reenactment Festival because you lost a bet, owed a favor, or otherwise got pressured or tricked into the role by a family member, friend, or coworker. Perhaps someone who was going to be one of the abductees but had to back out at the last moment, and so you ended up taking their place.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Charisma** or **Constitution**, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the Crafting skill and the Farming Lore skill. You gain the [[Hobnobber]] feat.

* * *

You can add one of the following two adjustments to any background to further modify your choice to match your vision for your PC.

**Family:** You and one (or more) other PCs are close family members (siblings, parent/child, married, etc.) If you take this adjustment, the other PC(s) who are your family must also take this adjustment. Choose one of the following to replace the skill feat you otherwise would've gained from your background. (You and your sibling need not share the same choiceâ€”a sibling who wants to keep their background's skill feat can pick "Typical" from the list.)

*   **Bickering:** You have a long-standing feud with your sibling(s). Whenever your sibling(s) critically fail a significant skill check or attack roll and you witness their failure, you gain a +1 status bonus to your saving throws until the end of your next turn as you secretly (or perhaps not so secretly) delight in their failure. 
*   **Close-Knit:** You and your sibling(s) work well together, and you go all-out to help them when they're badly hurt. When you provide [[Aid]] or [[Administer First Aid]] to your sibling(s), the DC is 5 lower than normal.
*   **Typical:** You have a standard relationship with your sibling(s); don't change your background's skill feat.

**Foundling:** You aren't a native to Willowshore, but you did grow up in the town. You might have adoptive parents, or you could've grown up on the streets. Choose one of the following to replace the bonus feat you otherwise would've gained from your background.

*   **Bitter:** You appreciate the town of Willowshore but still resent the conditions that resulted in you being abandoned or left in the town. You gain the [[Intimidating Glare]] skill feat.
*   **Mysterious:** You keep secrets, and very few in Willowshore (if anyone) know your history before you settled in the town, in part because you've taken to learning about Willowshore by watching rather than engaging in conversation. You gain the [[Streetwise]] skill feat.
*   **Outgoing:** You're grateful for the sense of belonging the townsfolk of Willowshore have extended to you and always do your best to repay that kindness. Once per week when you attempt a skill check to resolve a downtime activity that could benefit Willowshore (several of these activities are detailed in the adventures, and your GM can always make the call if another activity would qualify) and you fail that check, you instead succeed at the check, or if you critically fail at that check, you instead simply fail that check.
