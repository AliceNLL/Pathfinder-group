# Returned
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-background.svg|150]]

You died and miraculously returned with knowledge of the realms beyond death and a stronger link to life. Some dead and undead souls might feel a strange, instinctual kinship with you.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free ability boost.

You gain the [[Diehard]] feat and the [[Additional Lore]] feat for Boneyard Lore.
