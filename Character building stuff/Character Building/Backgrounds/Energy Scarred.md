# Energy Scarred
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-background.svg|150]]

Exposure to a significant magical event overloaded you with magical energy. Perhaps you were exposed to dangerous levels of magical energy that left you near death, or it built up over long-term exposure to a powerful source of magic.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be **Constitution** and one is a free ability boost.

Your innate magical trait is primal. Choose acid, cold, electricity, fire, force, sonic, vitality, or void. You are trained in a Lore skill associated with the chosen energy (such as Fire Lore) and you gain resistance to that energy type equal to half your level (minimum 1).
