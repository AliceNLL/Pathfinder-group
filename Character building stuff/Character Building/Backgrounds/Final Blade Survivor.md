# Final Blade Survivor
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-background.svg|150]]

**Prerequisite** Region - Shining Kingdoms

* * *

You fell prey to the whims of the Galtan mob and were scheduled for execution by _[[Final Blade]]_, but through skill-or sheer luck-you managed to talk your way out of it.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Charisma** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the Deception skill and the Revolution Lore skill. You gain the [[Charming Liar]] skill feat.
