# Empty Whispers
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-background.svg|150]]

You knew someone once, and now you know only a life stitched together and healed over, nary even a scar remaining. You hear voices of souls that have fallen through the cracks of reality, creatures who have been removed from memory, banished planar entities, and similar. Their whispers guide you.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Intelligence** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the Occultism skill and the Planar Rift Lore skill. You get a Planar Rift Lore check to sense planar rifts, even if you aren't specifically Investigating or Searching for them, as well as locations where magic has been used to remove the memory of an object or creature from existence.
