# Detective
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-background.svg|150]]

You solved crimes as a police inspector or took jobs for wealthy clients as a private investigator. You might have become an adventurer as part of your next big mystery, but likely it was due to the consequences or aftermath of a prior case.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Intelligence** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Society skill and the Underworld Lore skill. You gain the [[Streetwise]] skill feat.
