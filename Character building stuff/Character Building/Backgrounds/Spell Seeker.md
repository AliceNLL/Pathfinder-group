# Spell Seeker
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-background.svg|150]]

Conventional magic can only hold your attention for so long. Instead, you've devoted yourself to understanding truly esoteric spells, which invariably draws you to explore the world and all its eldritch traditions.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Intelligence** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in either the Arcana skill or Occult skill, as well as the Library Lore skill. You gain the [[Recognize Spell]] skill feat.
