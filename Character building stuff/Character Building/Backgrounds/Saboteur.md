# Saboteur
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-background.svg|150]]

Whether you do it for personal enjoyment or at the behest of a mercenary company or military organization, you have a knack for destroying things. You have a sense for an object or structure's weak spots and know where to deliver a hammer strike or alchemical bomb. You adventure to hone your skills or complete a particular mission.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Strength** or **Dexterity**, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the Thievery skill and the Engineering Lore skill. You gain the [[Concealing Legerdemain]] skill feat.
