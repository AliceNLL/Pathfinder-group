# Shadow Haunted
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-background.svg|150]]

**Prerequisite** Region - Old Cheliax

* * *

You are from Nidal, and regardless of your personal values, Zon-Kuthon has a claim on your soul due to an ancient pact. The Midnight Lord's unsettling influence is bred deep into your bones.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Intelligence** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the Intimidation skill and the Shadow Plane Lore skill. You gain the [[Quick Coercion]] skill feat.
