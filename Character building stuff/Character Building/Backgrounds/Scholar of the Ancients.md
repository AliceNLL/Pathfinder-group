You're fascinated by the lost Azlanti Empire and have dedicated yourself to seeking out and studying every broken artifact or scrap of knowledge that remains, whether as an academic pursuit or simply for the joy of treasure hunting.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Intelligence** or **Charisma**, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the Arcana skill and the Azlant Lore skills. You gain the [[Quick Identification]] skill feat.
