# Nirmathi Guerrilla
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-background.svg|150]]

**Prerequisite** Region - Eye of Dread

* * *

Woodcraft comes naturally to you, and you have learned how to use the forest to your tactical advantage against superior forces in skirmishes against the Molthuni army or the Ironfang Legion.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Dexterity** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the Stealth skill and the Forest Lore skill. You gain the [[Terrain Stalker]] (underbrush) skill feat.
