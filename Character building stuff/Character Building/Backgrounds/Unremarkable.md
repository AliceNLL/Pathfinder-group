# Unremarkable
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-background.svg|150]]

Your face is particularly unremarkable, even if your presence or actions may not be. You know how to use this to your advantage, making it difficult for people to identify and collect information about you.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Wisdom** or **Charisma**, and one is a free ability boost.

You are trained in the Deception skill and the Acting Lore skill. You gain the Lengthy Diversion skill feat.
