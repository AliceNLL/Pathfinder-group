# Vidrian Reformer
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-background.svg|150]]

**Prerequisite** Region - Mwangi Expanse

* * *

You know that the only way your homeland of Vidrian can remain free from outside conquerors is by forging a strong and unified government. As such, you seek to bind your fellow citizens together through careful diplomacy and force of personality-or, if necessary, subterfuge and intrigue.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Dexterity** or **Charisma**, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the Diplomacy skill and the Politics Lore skill. You gain the [[Hobnobber]] skill feat.
