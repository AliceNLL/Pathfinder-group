# Scavenger
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-background.svg|150]]

You've made a living sorting through the things society throws away. You might have scavenged simply to survive, or plied a trade as a ragpicker, dung carter, or the like. While you've left that life behind, you still keep one eye on the ground out of habit.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Intelligence** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the Survival skill and the Lore skill for the settlement you grew up scavenging in. You gain the [[Forager]] skill feat.
