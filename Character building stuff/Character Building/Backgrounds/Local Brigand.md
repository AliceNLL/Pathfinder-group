# Local Brigand
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-background.svg|150]]

You hail from the River Kingdoms or the more lawless reaches of Brevoy. Your life has been hard. You know how to ambush travelers, bully traders, avoid the law, and camp where no one can find you. Recently, you've run into some trouble, either with the law or with other bandits, and you're looking to get away to somewhere no one would ever think to look for you. An expedition into the rugged wilderness seems like a perfect way to lie low until the trouble blows over.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Strength** or **Constitution**, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the Intimidation skill and the Banditry Lore skill. You gain the [[Group Coercion]] skill feat.
