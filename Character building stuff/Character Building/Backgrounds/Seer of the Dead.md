# Seer of the Dead
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-background.svg|150]]

You have long been gifted with the ability to see and speak with the departed. This could have manifested at your birth or when a chance encounter linked you inextricably to the spirits of the dead. Their constant presence might feel like a curse, or it might provide you with welcome companionship.

You gain one ability boost. It must be to **Constitution** or **Wisdom**.

You're trained in Religion and Undead Lore. You gain the effects of the _[[Spirit Sense]]_ spell at all times.
