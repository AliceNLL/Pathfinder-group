# Gold Falls Regular
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-background.svg|150]]

You've long been a regular of Gold Falls Inn, a tavern located near Droskar's Crag in the Darkmoon Vale region of Andoran. The establishment is a frequent gathering place for adventurers, storytellers, and folk heroes. You took note of the Pathfinder Society's growing reputation in the area and decided to join up and seek adventure and fame of your own.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Charisma**, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the Performance skill, as well as your choice of the Cooking Lore skill or Volcano Lore skill. You gain the [[Impressive Performance]] skill feat.

Additionally, when you receive a mission briefing at Gold Falls Inn or a settlement in Darkmoon Vale, you can draw on your knowledge of the region and its many stories. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your checks to Gather Information or Recall Knowledge during the Getting Started segment of such adventures. Be sure to remind your GM that you have a relevant background.
