# Trailblazer
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-background.svg|150]]

Uncharted realms have always intrigued you, and you've explored and mapped large territories in service to merchants, governments, or your own curiosity. Where some see a blank spot on a map, you see the potential for something new and undiscovered.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the Survival skill and the Cartography Lore skill. You gain the [[Terrain Expertise]] skill feat with one terrain you've explored (such as forest or underground).
