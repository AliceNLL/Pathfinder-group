# Laborer
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-background.svg|150]]

You've spent years performing arduous physical labor. It was a difficult life, but you somehow survived. You may have embraced adventuring as an easier method to make your way in the world, or you might adventure under someone else's command.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Strength** or **Constitution**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Athletics skill and the Labor Lore skill. You gain the [[Hefty Hauler]] skill feat.
