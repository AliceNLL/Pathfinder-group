# Grave Robber
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-background.svg|150]]

Resurrectionist. Body snatcher. No matter what you're called, you know where the bodies are buried, and how many coins they'll fetch when dug up. Adventuring comes naturally to you-in your mind dungeons are just oversized tombs-as does returning home with your loot undetected.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Strength** or **Dexterity**, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the Stealth skill and the Underworld Lore skill. You gain the [[Experienced Smuggler]] skill feat.
