# Legacy of the Hammer
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-background.svg|150]]

Your introduction to the criminal life was spurred forward by a seemingly innocuous hammer that provided you with all kinds of innovative criminal ideas. It has since left your possession, but every now and then you hear a faint whisper urging you toward crime.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Dexterity** or **Charisma**, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the Thievery skill and Engineering Lore. You gain the [[Concealing Legerdemain]] skill feat.
