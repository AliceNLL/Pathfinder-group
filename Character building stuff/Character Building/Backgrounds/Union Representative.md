# Union Representative
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-background.svg|150]]

You might have fought for fairer ore distribution for the Metalmaker's Union, higher chef's pay in the Provisioners' Union, or better mercenary contracts for the Union of Axe and Coin. Whatever the case, you have experience in the high-stakes world of the negotiating table, experience that translates surprisingly well to adventuring.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Intelligence** or **Charisma**, the other is a free boost.

You're trained in the Diplomacy skill and the Legal Lore skill. You gain the [[Contract Negotiator]] skill feat.
