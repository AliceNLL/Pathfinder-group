# Oenopion-Ooze Tender
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-background.svg|150]]

**Prerequisite** Region - Impossible Lands

* * *

Your apprenticeship in one of Oenopion's unorthodox arcane and alchemical academies instilled in you a deep reservoir of mostly reliable esoteric knowledge, not to mention a deep resentment born of countless hours spent mucking ooze pens and feeding helpless creatures to ravenous, belching jellies and gelatinous puddings.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Intelligence**, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the Crafting skill and the Ooze Lore skill. You gain the [[Dubious Knowledge]] skill feat.
