# Lesser Scion
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-background.svg|150]]

You are the youngest child in a noble house (in Cheliax, Isger, or Andoran) and stand to inherit nothing from your family. Although you have a minor title, it affords you no lands or wealth, but it has garnered you a small amount of respect and deference in your travels. When play begins, you are riding in a caravan bound for Almas, where a cousin has promised to allow you to stay with them for a month.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Dexterity** or **Intelligence**, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the Diplomacy skill and the Heraldry Lore skill. You gain the [[Hobnobber]] skill feat.
