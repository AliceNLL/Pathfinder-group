# Scion of Slayers
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-background.svg|150]]

You were born into a lineage of undead slayers. No mere occupation, in your family slaying is a mantle of almost mystic responsibility passed from parent to child. Over the generations, this single-minded focus has begun to manifest in uncanny ways during combat.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Strength** or **Intelligence**, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the Athletics skill and the Undead Lore skill. You can cast _[[Vitality Lash]]_ as an innate divine cantrip. You can use Intelligence as your spellcasting ability for this innate spell.
