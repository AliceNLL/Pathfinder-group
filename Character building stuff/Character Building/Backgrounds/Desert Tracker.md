# Desert Tracker
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-background.svg|150]]

**Prerequisite** Region - Golden Road

* * *

You're at home blazing trails in the burning sands, and you made a living guiding or following creatures in the desert. You might be a native nomad, an experienced desert guide, a naturalist, a bandit driven into the dunes by the law-or all of the above.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the Survival skill and the Desert Lore skill. You gain the [[Experienced Tracker]] skill feat.
