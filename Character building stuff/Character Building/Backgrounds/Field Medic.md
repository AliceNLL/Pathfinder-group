# Field Medic
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-background.svg|150]]

In the chaotic rush of battle, you learned to adapt to rapidly changing conditions as you administered to battle casualties. You patched up soldiers, guards, or other combatants, and learned a fair amount about the logistics of war.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Medicine skill and the Warfare Lore skill. You gain the [[Battle Medicine]] skill feat.
