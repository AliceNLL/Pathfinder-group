# Razmiran Faithful
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-background.svg|150]]

**Prerequisite** Region - Broken Lands

* * *

You serve a living god who rules upon the face of Golarion, and this gives your actions a divine mandate not to be trifled with.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Strength** or **Charisma**, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the Intimidation skill and the Razmir Lore skill. You gain the [[Group Coercion]] skill feat.
