# Willing Host
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-background.svg|150]]

You speak to spirits only you can perceive: wispy shreds of lost souls, household guardians, ancestral spirits, and other entities. You can negotiate with these beings, allowing them into your body to impart knowledge or aid in a task for the price of a favor.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Wisdom** or **Charisma**, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the Spirit Lore skill. You gain the [[Host Spirit]] action.
