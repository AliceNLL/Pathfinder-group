# Press-Ganged (G&G)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-background.svg|150]]

Was it five shots or six? It doesn't really matter in the end, because after those nice folks bought all your drinks, you woke up on the lowest rung of the ladder. Whether a crewmate on a ship, a conscript in an army, or something worse, you've nowhere to go but up. This background generally requires buy-in with the entire group to tell a story allowing you to play a character starting their adventuring due to circumstances outside their own control. However, you can also play a character who was once press-ganged and has since escaped that life. If you do, press-ganged doesn't have the uncommon trait, and it has the same mechanical effects either way.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Strength** or **Constitution**, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the Athletics skill and the Labor Lore skill. You gain the [[Armor Assist]] skill feat.
