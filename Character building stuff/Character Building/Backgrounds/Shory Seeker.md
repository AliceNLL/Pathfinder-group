# Shory Seeker
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-background.svg|150]]

You've dedicated your life to unraveling the secrets of the ancient Shory Empire, either through meticulous research or by traveling into dangerous and distant ruins to track down long-lost artifacts.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Dexterity** or **Intelligence**, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the Crafting skill and the Shory Lore skill. You gain the [[Specialty Crafting]] skill feat.
