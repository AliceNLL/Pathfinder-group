# Quick
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-background.svg|150]]

**Prerequisite** Region - Impossible Lands

* * *

Staying alive among the scheming, ravenous undead of Geb required a deep knowledge of their motivations, capabilities, and weaknesses. More often than not, it also required the ability to weave alibis and life-preserving half-truths capable of swaying a stilled heart.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Charisma** or **Constitution**, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the Deception skill and the Undead Lore skill. You gain the [[Charming Liar]] skill feat.
