**Prerequisite** Region - High Seas

* * *

At least one of your parents is a member of the notorious Red Mantis assassins, merciless killers for hire who rarely fail to claim their marks. Whether on purpose or by simple exposure, you were trained from a young age in the art of stalking and killing people.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Dexterity** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the Stealth skill and the Assassin Lore skill. You gain the [[Assurance]] skill feat with Stealth.
