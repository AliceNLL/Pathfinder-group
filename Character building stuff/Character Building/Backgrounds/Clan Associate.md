# Clan Associate
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-background.svg|150]]

You already have a close connection to Clan Tolorr, such as having been born into the clan, worked as an esteemed contractor for them, or married into the clan (even if you chose to retain your prior clan affiliation). Whether through dedicated study or just overhearing your fellows' academic debates, you've absorbed boundless trivia about historyâ€”especially local lore. Beyond Tolorr halls, your affiliation earns you respect in Highhelm. Your clan expects you to behave well, as your actions reflect on them.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the Society skill and the Highhelm Lore skill. You gain the [[Multilingual]] skill feat.

**Connection:** You have no special connection or sponsor in Clan Tolorr.

**Reputation Points:** +2
