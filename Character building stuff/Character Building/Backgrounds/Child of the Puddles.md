![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-background.svg|150]]

**Prerequisite** Region - Absalom and Starstone Isle

* * *

You grew up in the soggy, squalid quarter of Absalom known as the Puddles. You're at home in tightly packed urban environments.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Dexterity** or **Intelligence**, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the Acrobatics skill, and the Absalom Lore skill. You gain the [[Steady Balance]] skill feat.
