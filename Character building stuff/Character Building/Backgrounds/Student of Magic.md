# Student of Magic
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-background.svg|150]]

You are currently enrolled at a school of magic, where you're learning the fundamentals of your magical tradition. Whether your adventuring occurs during breaks between semesters, as part of a work study program, or even within the halls of the academy itself, you'll have to learn to juggle your dual life.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Intelligence** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in your choice of Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion, as well as Academia Lore. You gain the [[Recognize Spell]] skill feat.
