# Mystic Tutor
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-background.svg|150]]

You spent years predicting, identifying, and harnessing the innate magical talents of those around you. A magic-rich world has taught you that you can never have too much training when everyone around you is capable of magic.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be **Intelligence** or **Wisdom** and one is a free ability boost. Your innate magical trait is arcane or occult.

You're trained in either Arcana or Occultism, depending on your innate magical trait, and the Academia Lore skill. You gain the [[Recognize Spell]] skill feat.
