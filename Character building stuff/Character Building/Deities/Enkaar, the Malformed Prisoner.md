# Enkaar, the Malformed Prisoner
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-deity.svg|150]]

This mutilated horror is the Forsaken patron of fetters, lethargy, and physical corruption.

* * *

An owb prophet can transfer the power they gain from a Forsaken patron to those who worship them, effectively serving as a deity. Each owb prophet decides their own follower alignments, edicts, and anathema.
