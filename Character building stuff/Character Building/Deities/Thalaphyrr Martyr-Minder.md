# Thalaphyrr Martyr-Minder
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-deity.svg|150]]

The Forsaken patron of failed heroics, imprisonment, and squandered time.

* * *

An owb prophet can transfer the power they gain from a Forsaken patron to those who worship them, effectively serving as a deity. Each owb prophet decides their own follower alignments, edicts, and anathema.
