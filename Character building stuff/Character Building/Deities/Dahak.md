# Dahak
![[systems-pf2e-icons-deity-Dahak.webp|150]]

Dragons believe Dahak was one of the original gods created by Apsu and Tiamat at the beginning of creation. While the other deities began to create, Dahak chose to destroy. He is credited with transforming Hell into a place of agony and flame. He is also believed to be the creator of the metallic dragons, which he formed solely to hunt as sport. Seeing the destruction and chaos wrought, Apsu entered the Material Plane in order to end Dahak's reign of terror. However, Tiamat saw Dahak as a son and wanted him spared. In a deal to save Dahak, Tiamat healed some of the wounded metallic dragons. These dragons became the original chromatic dragons.

**Edicts** Kill metallic dragons, destroy things at your whim

**Anathema** Spare a foe after you have chosen to kill them, forgive a slight
