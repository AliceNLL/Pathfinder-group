# Daikitsu
![[systems-pf2e-icons-deity-Daikitsu.webp|150]]

It is not surprising that the Tian Xia goddess Daikitsu is a common object of veneration, given that she has the everyday subjects of rice, agriculture, and craftsmanship under her divine purview. Her holy symbol is that of a nine-tailed fox.

**Edicts** Ensure the health of crops and vegetation, perfect a craft or trade, leave offerings for foxes, celebrate the turning of the seasons
