# Reshmit of the Heavy Voice
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-deity.svg|150]]

Taking the form of a massive shadow, Reshmit is the Forsaken patron of broken things, forgetting, and unexpected violence.

* * *

An owb prophet can transfer the power they gain from a Forsaken patron to those who worship them, effectively serving as a deity. Each owb prophet decides their own follower alignments, edicts, and anathema.
