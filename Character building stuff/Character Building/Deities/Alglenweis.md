**Alglenweis** is the daughter of Kostchtchie and one of the major deities formerly worshipped in Sarkoris. She teaches her followers to perfect their craft and protect works of art, and be ready to act if necessary.

**Edicts** Strive to perfect an art or graft, protect the monuments of your people, stir others into action

**Anathema** Destroy an artistic creation without providing something in its place, refuse to act if called upon
