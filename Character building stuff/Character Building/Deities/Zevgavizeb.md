# Zevgavizeb
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-deity.svg|150]]

The Beast of Gluttondark's sphere of influence encompasses caverns, reptiles, the strong, and all-consuming hunger. A primordial qlippoth-turned-demon lord, Zevgavizeb seems to care little for his followers, and so he is more often propitiated than worshipped.
