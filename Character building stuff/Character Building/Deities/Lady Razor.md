# Lady Razor
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-deity.svg|150]]

This stern magistrate forbids showing kindness or mercy to family members. Lady Razor is the Forsaken patron of family strife, suspicion, and vengeance.

* * *

An owb prophet can transfer the power they gain from a Forsaken patron to those who worship them, effectively serving as a deity. Each owb prophet decides their own follower alignments, edicts, and anathema.
