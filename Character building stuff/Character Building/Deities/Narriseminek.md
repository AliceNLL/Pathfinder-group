# Narriseminek
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-deity.svg|150]]

Called the Crownless and the Maker of Kings, Narriseminek often appears as a protean with a scar around their pate, as if left by a burning crown. Their true form, though similar, is rarely seen: an iridescent and golden protean with a halo of burning eyes but empty eye sockets. The protean lord of ascendance, keketars, and revelations rarely interacts with non-proteans, but to their protean worshippers, they offer exalted transformations and revelations that can change a being's entire outlook. Worshippers of Narriseminek, both mortal and protean, spend their time divining the future and using magic to transform their bodies-a practice they also extend to any other willing creatures who ask. Their revelations take the form of patterns emerging in otherwise random events; Narriseminek's followers reject astrology and other forms of divination based on predictable cycles.

**Edicts** Divine the future, transform the bodies of willing creatures, rebel against organized structures

**Anathema** Refuse to speak to a keketar, eschew a challenge by turning down a promotion or an advancement

**Areas of Concern** ascendance, keketars, and revelations
