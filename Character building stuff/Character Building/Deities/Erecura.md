![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-deity.svg|150]]

**Erecura** is the queen of Dis, second layer of Hell, and the wife of its ruler, the archdevil Dispater. Despite being an authority figure in Hell, her outlook and motivation are far removed from that of devils, and unclear to even her own husband.

**Edicts** Manipulate dangerous beings and opportunities to your benefit, thrive in hostile conditions, divine the future

**Anathema** Despoil nature, kill a natural plant or animal that has managed to thrive outside of its intended environment
