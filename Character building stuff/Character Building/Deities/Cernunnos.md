# Cernunnos
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-deity.svg|150]]

Knowing that he is still one person despite his power, Cernunnos trains commanders and emissaries to fight evil in both the Material Plane and the First World. The faithful of Cernunnos are mainly intelligent plant creatures, fey, and mortal rangers and druids. Elves view him as patron of luck, while others pray to him for strength. Hidden groves, waterfalls and deep forests are sacred to Cernunnos.
