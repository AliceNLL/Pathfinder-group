# Asmodeus
![[systems-pf2e-icons-deity-Asmodeus.webp|150]]

Asmodeus, Prince of Darkness, delights in tempting mortals to give in to corruption. He promotes hierarchies where everyone knows their place, and he takes advantage of order for his own selfish benefit.

**Edicts** negotiate contracts to your best advantage, rule tyrannically and torture weaker beings, show subservience to your betters

**Anathema** break a contract, share power with the weak, insult Asmodeus by showing mercy to your enemies

**Areas of Concern** contracts, oppression, pride, and tyranny
