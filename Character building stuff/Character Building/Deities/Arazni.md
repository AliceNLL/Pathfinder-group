# Arazni
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-deity.svg|150]]

More than anything, Arazni is a survivor. Once, long ago, she was a force for good, a warrior-mage who sought to improve the quality of life for residents of her homeland. Long after her mortal death, she returned as a herald of the god Aroden and fought alongside mortals during one of their darkest hours. But humanity and her patron alike abandoned her-first to the Whispering Tyrant, then to the necromancer Geb-and the torments she endured because of it changed her deeply. Still she survived, her broken body reanimated against her will as a powerful undead monstrosity. For over a millennium she was held captive as the lich queen of the undead nation of Geb, and her view of mortals, and humanity in particular, soured.
