![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-deity.svg|150]]

**Alocer** is a lawful evil diabolic demigod, the infernal duke of beasts, hunters, and tradition. Known also as the Pack Lord, he appears as a fire-breathing, lion-headed, heavily armored archer with eagle talons for feet. His symbol is a dragon-legged horse, said to be a representation of his favored mount.

**Edicts** hunt those who are capable of thinking for themselves, gather like-minded hunters into groups based in hunting lodges, burn places of worship devoted to Erastil or corrupt those who follow his faith

**Anathema** sleep in a place sacred to Erastil, willingly harm a lion, grant a merciful death to a creature you have wounded
