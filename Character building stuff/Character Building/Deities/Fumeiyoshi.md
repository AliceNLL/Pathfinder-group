**Fumeiyoshi** is a Tian Xia deity most often associated with the undead and graves, although he is also the patron deity of the evil oni.

**Edicts** Punish those who have good fortune they don't deserve, devour the pleasures of the living, encourage resentment, make graveyards supernaturally unsafe

**Anathema** Pass by food without stealing a bite, allow honor or tradition to prevent you from taking what you want
