# Kols
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-deity.svg|150]]

Kols, known to his faithful as the Oath-Keeper (or Oathkeeper), is the dwarven demigod of duty. His personal duties are following and serving his father Torag and protecting his brother Grundinnar, and sister Bolka. He is also the deity tasked with exacting punishment on those poor souls who shirk their responsibilities or break sworn oaths and solemn promises. Some believe that Dranngvit, the dwarven goddess of vengeance, is Kols' true mother.

**Edicts** Seek those that break oaths and enforce just restitution, uphold your promises

**Anathema** Lie, dishonor yourself or your family, shirk your duties, break an oath
