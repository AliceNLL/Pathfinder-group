# Rovagug
![[systems-pf2e-icons-deity-Rovagug.webp|150]]

Rovagug, the Rough Beast, was long ago imprisoned within Golarion's core at the hands of many other deities working in concert, and he seeks to one day break free and wreak havoc upon the world. He is served by his spawn and those who seek the ultimate destruction of all things.

**Edicts** destroy all things, free Rovagug from his prison

**Anathema** create something new, let material ties restrain you, torture a victim or otherwise delay its destruction

**Areas of Concern** destruction, disaster, and wrath
