# Constructed Body
![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-classes-expert-overdrive.webp|150]]

Your physiological needs are different than those of living creatures. You don't need to eat or drink. You don't need to sleep, but you still need a daily period of rest. During this period of rest, you must enter a recuperating standby state for 2 hours, which is similar to sleeping except you are aware of your surroundings and don't take penalties for being [[Unconscious]]. Much like with sleeping, if you go too long without entering your standby state, you become [[Fatigued]] and can't recover until you enter standby for 2 hours.
