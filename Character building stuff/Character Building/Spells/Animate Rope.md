# Animate Rope
![[icons-sundries-survival-rope-wrapped-red.webp|150]]

You cause a length or section of [[Rope]] or a rope-like object to animate and follow simple commands. You can give it two commands when you [[Cast a Spell|Cast the Spell]], and one command each time you [[Sustain|Sustain the Spell]].

* * *

*   **Bind** (attack) The Rope attempts to partially bind a creature. Attempt a spell attack roll against the target's Reflex DC. If you succeed, the target takes a -10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speed (-20-foot on a critical success). This ends if the target [[Escape|Escapes]] against your spell DC or breaks the Rope. (A standard adventuring Rope has Hardness 2, HP 8, and a Broken Threshold of 4.)
*   **Coil** The Rope forms a tidy, coiled stack.
*   **Crawl** The Rope inches along the ground like a snake, moving one of its ends 10 feet. The Rope must move along a surface, but that surface doesn't need to be horizontal.
*   **Knot** The Rope ties a sturdy knot in itself.
*   **Loop** The Rope forms a simple loop at one or both ends, or straightens itself back out.
*   **Tie** The Rope ties itself around a willing creature or an object that's unattended or attended by a willing creature.
*   **Undo** The Rope undoes one of its knots, ties, or bindings.

* * *

**Heightened (+2)** The range increases by 50 feet, and you can animate 50 more feet of Rope.
