# Inkshot
![[icons-magic-acid-projectile-smoke-glowing.webp|150]]

A spray of viscous, toxic ink jets from your fingertip to strike a target creature in the face. Make a spell attack roll against the target. On a hit, you deal 2d6 poison damage, plus you blast the target's eyes, making them [[Dazzled]] for 1 round as the stinging ink blurs and distorts the creature's vision. On a critical hit, double the poison damage, and the target becomes dazzled for 1 minute by the foul ink.

The ink stain remains for 1 hour before fading, although vigorous cleansing (or magic such as a prestidigitation cantrip) can remove the ink before then.

**Heightened (+1)** Increase the base poison damage by 2d6.
