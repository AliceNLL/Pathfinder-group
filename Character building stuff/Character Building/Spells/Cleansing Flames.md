# Cleansing Flames
![[icons-magic-fire-flame-burning-campfire-rocks.webp|150]]

You wrap the target in purifying flames. You can attempt to counteract a single poison or non-curse effect imparting the [[Clumsy 1|Clumsy]], [[Dazzled]], [[Enfeebled 1|Enfeebled]], [[Fatigued]], [[Frightened]], [[Paralyzed]], [[Sickened 1|Sickened]], or [[Stupefied]] condition. The target can choose to empower the flames with their life force, becoming [[Drained 1]] (or increasing their drained value by 1, if already under the condition) to grant you a +1 circumstance bonus to your counteract check.
