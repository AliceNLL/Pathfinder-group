# Mind Probe
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-mind-probe.webp|150]]

You cast your thoughts through a creature's mind, sifting for information. You access the target's memories and knowledge unless it fends you off with a Will save.

**Success** The target is unaffected.

**Failure** Each round of the spell's duration, you can Sustain the spell to ask a different question and attempt to uncover the answer. For each question, the target can attempt a Deception check against your spell DC; if the target succeeds, you don't learn the answer, and on a critical success, the target gives you a false answer that you believe is truthful Once you've asked the target a given question, asking it again, even with a separate casting of mind probe, produces the same result.

**Critical Failure** As failure, and the target takes a â€“4 circumstance penalty to Deception checks against your questions.
