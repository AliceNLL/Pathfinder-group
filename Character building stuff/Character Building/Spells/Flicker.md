# Flicker
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-blink.webp|150]]

You flicker quickly between your current plane and another. You gain resistance 5 to all damage, except force. At the end of each of your turns, you automatically teleport 10 feet in a random direction, as determined by the GM. You can Sustain the spell to teleport in this way.

* * *

**Heightened (+2)** The resistance increases by 3.
