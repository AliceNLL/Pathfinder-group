# Gouging Claw
![[icons-creatures-claws-claw-hooked-curved.webp|150]]

You temporarily morph your limb into a clawed appendage. Make a melee spell attack roll against your target's AC. If you hit, you deal your choice of 2d6 slashing damage or 2d6 piercing damage, plus 2 bleed damage. On a critical success, you deal double damage and double bleed damage.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d6 and the persistent bleed damage increases by 1.
