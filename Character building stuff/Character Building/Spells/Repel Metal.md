# Repel Metal
![[icons-magic-defensive-shield-barrier-deflect-gold.webp|150]]

**Trigger** A Strike with a metallic weapon or projectile would hit you or an ally within range.

* * *

You call forth a repelling field. The target gains a +2 circumstance bonus to AC against the triggering attack. If the attack then misses, you direct the Strike back at the attacker, who compares the attack roll to their own AC. The target then becomes immune to this spell for 10 minutes.
