# Life Connection
![[icons-magic-life-cross-yellow-green.webp|150]]

When you cast this spell, you place a failsafe deep within the life force of the target. You can sense when the target takes damage, provided you're within 1 mile of one another. A creature can be part of no more than one life connection simultaneously. When the spell is complete, you gain the [[Defend Life]] reaction; once you use the reaction, the spell ends.
