# Steal Shadow
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-steal-shadow.webp|150]]

You steal a creature's shadow, leaving it weakened and vulnerable. The target must attempt a Fortitude save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target is [[Enfeebled 1]] for 1 round.

**Failure** The target takes 3d4 void damage and is [[Enfeebled 1]] for the spell's duration as you tear its shadow away, collecting it in your hand. On subsequent rounds, the first time each round you [[Sustain|Sustain the Spell]], you can throttle the shadow to deal 3d4 void damage to the target (basic Fortitude save). Until the spell ends, the target doesn't cast a shadow.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target is [[Enfeebled 1|Enfeebled 2]].

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The damage when the spell is cast and when it is sustained increases by 1d4 void.
