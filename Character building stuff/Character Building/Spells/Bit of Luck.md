# Bit of Luck
![[icons-magic-control-buff-luck-fortune-green.webp|150]]

You tilt the scales of luck slightly to protect a creature from disaster. When the target would attempt a saving throw, it can roll twice and use the better result. Once it does this, the spell ends.

If you cast _bit of luck_ again, any previous _bit of luck_ you cast that's still in effect ends. After a creature has been targeted with _bit of luck,_ it becomes temporarily immune for 24 hours.
