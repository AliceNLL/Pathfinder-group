# Brain Drain
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-brain-drain.webp|150]]

You probe the target's mind to glean knowledge. This deals 1d8 mental damage with a basic Will save.

If the target fails the save, you sort through the stolen memories to attempt a single check to [[Recall Knowledge]]. Choose a skill that has the Recall Knowledge action, and use the target's skill modifier for the check.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The mental damage increases by 1d8.
