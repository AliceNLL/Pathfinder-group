# Sweet Dream
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-sweet-dream.webp|150]]

With your soothing words, you lull the target into an enchanting dream. When you Cast the Spell, the target falls [[Unconscious]] if it wasn't already. While unconscious, it experiences a dream of your choice, though lucidly enough it can wake when it pleases. If it wakes up before 1 minute of sleep has passed, the spell ends.
