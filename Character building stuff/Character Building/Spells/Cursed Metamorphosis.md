# Cursed Metamorphosis
![[icons-creatures-amphibians-frog-confused-green-blue.webp|150]]

You transform the target creature into a harmless animal appropriate to the area, with effects based on its Fortitude save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target's body gains minor features of the harmless animal. Its insides churn as they partially transform, causing it to be [[Sickened 1]]. When it recovers from the Sickened condition, its features revert to normal.

**Failure** The target transforms for 1 minute but keeps its mind. If it spends all its actions on its turn concentrating on its original form, it can attempt a Will save to end the effect immediately.

**Critical Failure** The target is transformed into the chosen harmless animal, body and mind, for an unlimited duration.
