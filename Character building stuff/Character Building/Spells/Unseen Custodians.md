# Unseen Custodians
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-unseen-custodians.webp|150]]

You create a site-bound, long-lasting _[[Phantasmal Minion]]_ spell effect, forming entities of pure force to carry out basic tasks at a fixed location.

* * *

**Critical Success** The ritual creates six unseen servants. You don't need to concentrate on them, and they aren't summoned minions. You can spend an action, which has the concentrate trait, to command one to perform a basic task; it continues to perform the task until commanded again.

**Success** As critical success, but the ritual creates three unseen servants.

**Failure** The ritual fails to create any servants.

**Critical Failure** The ritual creates six unseen servants, but these creatures are hostile and capable of making fist [[Strike|Strikes]] with an attack bonus equal to your skill modifier for the primary skill check, dealing 1d6 force damage. They attack you and your allies and attempt to break objects belonging to you and your allies within the area.

* * *

**Heightened (6th)** If destroyed, the unseen servants reform the next morning. The cost increases to 30 gp.
