**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The target takes half damage.

**Failure** The target takes half damage, and feels as though it's being crushed. The target becomes [[Grabbed]] and takes 6d6 bludgeoning damage; it can attempt to [[Escape]] with an Escape DC equal to your spell DC.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target takes double damage.
