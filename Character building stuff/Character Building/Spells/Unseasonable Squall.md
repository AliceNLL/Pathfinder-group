# Unseasonable Squall
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-unseasonable-squall.webp|150]]

You issue a blast of sudden wind that ripples outward from the center of the burst. The wind extinguishes small non-magical fires, disperses fog and mist, scatters objects of light Bulk or less, and pushes unsecured objects of 1 Bulk or less 5 feet away from the spell's origin point. Each Medium or smaller creature in the area when you Cast the Spell or that moves into spell's area must attempt a Fortitude saving throw.

* * *

**Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Failure** The creature is knocked [[Prone]]. If the creature was Flying, it gets a critical failure instead.

**Critical Failure** The creature is pushed 30 feet away from the center of the burst, is knocked Prone, and takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage.
