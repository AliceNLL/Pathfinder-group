# Read Aura
![[icons-magic-light-explosion-star-glow-silhouette.webp|150]]

You focus on the target object, opening your mind to perceive magical auras. When the casting is complete, you know whether that item is magical. You or anyone you advise about the aura gains a +2 circumstance bonus to [[Identify Magic]] on the item. If the object is illusory, you detect this only if the effect's rank is lower than the rank of your _read aura_ spell.
