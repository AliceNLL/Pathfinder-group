# Blink Charge
![[icons-magic-sonic-projectile-shock-wave-blue.webp|150]]

You propel yourself through the fabric of space to deal a blow carrying the momentum of your teleportation. You teleport to an empty space adjacent to a creature you can see within range, then make a Strike against the creature with a weapon you're wielding. The Strike deals damage, plus an extra 2d8 force damage, depending on the result of your Strike.

* * *

**Critical Success** Double damage, plus after the Strike, you can teleport the target into an empty space up to 5 feet away from its current position. The new space must be on the ground if it started on the ground, in the air if it was flying, and so on.

**Success** The Strike deals full damage.

**Failure** The Strike deals no damage, but the target takes 1d8 force damage.

**Critical Failure** The Strike deals no damage, and you take 1d8 force damage.

**Heightened (+2)** The spell's range increases by 60 feet, and any force damage the spell deals is increased by 1d8 force.
