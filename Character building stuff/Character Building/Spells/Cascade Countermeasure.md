# Cascade Countermeasure
![[icons-magic-water-barrier-ice-shield.webp|150]]

You quickly adjust your [[Arcane Cascade]] to offer magical protection. You gain resistance 5 against damage from spells. As normal, using Arcane Cascade again means you've ended the stance, and the spell ends.

* * *

**Heightened (+3)** The resistance increases by 5.

_Note: Conflux spells refresh Spellstrike._
