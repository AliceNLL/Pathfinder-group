# Touch of Corruption (Healing)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-touch-of-corruption.webp|150]]

You infuse the target with void energy. If the target is living, this deals 1d6 void damage (basic Fortitude save); on a failed save, the target also takes a -2 status penalty to AC for 1 round.

If the target is a willing undead creature, the target instead regains 6 Hit Points, and if you are the undead target, you also gain a +2 status bonus to damage rolls for 1 round.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** Increase the damage dealt to a living creature by 1d6 or increase the Hit Points regained by undead by 6.
