A palm-sized raw fruit or vegetable of your choice appears in your open hand. A creature can consume the food with an Interact action to regain 3d10+12 Hit Points and be nourished as if it had eaten a meal. If uneaten, the food crumbles to dust after 1 minute.

**Heightened (+1)** The Hit Points restored increase by 6.
