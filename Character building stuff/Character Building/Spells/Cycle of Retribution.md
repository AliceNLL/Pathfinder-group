# Cycle of Retribution
![[icons-magic-unholy-projectiles-binary-pink.webp|150]]

An understanding of how violence begets more violence fills your target, causing it mental anguish when it attempts to take violent actions. The target must attempt a Will saving throw.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The next time the target takes a hostile action, the target takes 1d4 mental damage; the spell's duration then ends.

**Failure** The first time in a round when the target takes a hostile action, the target takes 1d4 mental damage.

**Critical Failure** Each time the target takes a hostile action, the target takes 1d4 mental damage.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The mental damage increases by 1d4.
