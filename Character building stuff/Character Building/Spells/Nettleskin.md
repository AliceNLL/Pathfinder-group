# Nettleskin
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-nettleskin.webp|150]]

Thorns sprout from your body; they pass through and don't damage any clothing or armor you wear.

Adjacent creatures that hit you with a melee or unarmed attack take 1d4 piercing damage as the nettles jab them and break off. Each time a creature takes damage in this way, _nettleskin_'s duration decreases by 1 round.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d4.
