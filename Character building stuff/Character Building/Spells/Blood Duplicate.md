# Blood Duplicate
![[icons-skills-wounds-blood-drip-droplet-red.webp|150]]

This spell deals you 1 piercing damage as you shape a magical duplicate of the target from your blood; you can't cast this spell if you don't have blood. This spell can't duplicate an item made of precious materials, or materials with a rarity of uncommon or higher. If you're ever more than 5 feet from the duplicate, the spell's duration immediately ends. The Perception DC to recognize the duplicate as false using any sense except touch is equal to 10 + your spellcasting ability modifier + your Crafting proficiency bonus. The item feels wet and obviously fake to the touch. When the spell ends, the item collapses into a puddle of blood that quickly evaporates.
