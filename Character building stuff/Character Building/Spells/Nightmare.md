# Nightmare
![[icons-magic-control-encase-creature-spider-hold.webp|150]]

You send disturbing nightmares to your target. The next time the target falls asleep, it must attempt a Will save. If you know the target only by name and have never met them, the target gets a +4 circumstance bonus to the Will save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target suffers no adverse effects and is temporarily immune for 1 week.

**Success** The target experiences the nightmares but suffers no adverse effects other than unpleasant memories.

**Failure** The target experiences the nightmares and awakens [[Fatigued]].

**Critical Failure** The target experiences the nightmares, awakens Fatigued, and is [[Drained 1|Drained 2]] until it is no longer Fatigued.
