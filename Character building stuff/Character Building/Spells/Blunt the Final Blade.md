# Blunt the Final Blade
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-blade-barrier.webp|150]]

You anoint the _[[Final Blade]]_ with powdered mithral and grave dirt while speaking softly and carefully to the souls trapped within it. You create a mystical pathway for the souls to escape through and urge them to draw out the magic of the final blade with them as they depart.

* * *

**Critical Success** As success, and the souls also grant a boon; the primary and secondary casters gain a +2 status bonus to saves against death and fear effects for the next year.

**Success** The souls escape the _final blade_ and peacefully pass on to their eternal rewards, as appropriate for each soul. The final blade is no longer magical; it can't store anymore souls and can be destroyed as a normal guillotine.

**Failure** The ritual has no effect.

**Critical Failure** The ritual goes horribly wrong. The souls within the _final blade_ are released in a furious rush as a gray death that does its best to slay the ritual's casters and run amok among the living. The _final blade_ retains it abilities and can continue to store souls.
