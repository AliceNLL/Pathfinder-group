# Unblinking Flame Emblem
![[icons-magic-fire-projectile-fireball-embers-yellow.webp|150]]

**Trigger** Your last action was a successful Strike against an enemy

* * *

You emblazon the target with a fiery sigil that projects your sight and your flame onto them, allowing you and your allies to track their movements and making it easier to hit them. Attack rolls against the target gain a +1 status bonus, and successful Strikes against the target deal 1d6 fire damage, and 1d10 persistent,fire damage on a critical hit. However, you're [[Off-Guard]] against other enemies, as the information from the emblem distracts you. The emblem takes your full attention; if you use _unblinking flame emblem_ again before the original duration expires, the new casting replaces the previous casting.

* * *

**Heightened (9th)** The fire damage increases to 1d8 fire damage, and the persistent fire damage on a critical hit increases to 1d12 persistent,fire.
