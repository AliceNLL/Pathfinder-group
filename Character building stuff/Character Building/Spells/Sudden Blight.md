You accelerate the processes of decay in the area. Each living creature in the area takes 2d10 void damage (basic Fortitude save). A creature afflicted by a disease takes a -2 circumstance penalty to this save.You can also direct the blight to rot all Small and Tiny non-creature plants in the area, eliminating non-magical undergrowth and any resulting difficult terrain, cover, and concealment. _Sudden blight_ attempts to counteract any magical effect on the plants before withering them.

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d10.
