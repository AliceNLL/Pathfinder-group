# Path of Least Resistance
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-path-of-least-resistance.webp|150]]

You trace several possible routes, quickly resetting the timeline until you find the safest one. Choose three spaces you could reach with two Stride actions. Each must be at least 20 feet from the other two. You Stride twice to one of the spaces, determined randomly by the GM from among the paths you chose. If some of the paths contain a hidden danger, such as a trap that you would trigger by walking into the trap's affected area, the GM doesn't consider this path when randomly determining which one you take, but if all options have a hidden danger, the GM randomly chooses between all three paths. This movement doesn't trigger reactions.
