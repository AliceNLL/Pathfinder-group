# Whirling Flames
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-whirling-flames.webp|150]]

You call forth a storm of whirling flames, engulfing all creatures in that area and dealing 5d6 fire damage with a basic Reflex save.

* * *

**Heightened (+2)** The damage increases by 3d6, and you can add another non-overlapping 5-foot burst to the area.
