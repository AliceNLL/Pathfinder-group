# Ectoplasmic Expulsion
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-ectoplasmic-expulsion.webp|150]]

You call upon tendrils of ephemeral ectoplasm to pass through the target and carry away a harmful psychic affliction. You immediately attempt to counteract a single effect on the target with the emotion or possession trait, or an effect giving the target the [[Controlled]] or [[Fascinated]] condition. If you fail to counteract the effect, you nevertheless set up a resonance that allows the target to more ably escape the effect on its own; for the next hour, the target gains a +2 status bonus to Will saves to shrug off the effect you failed to counteract (such as Will saves to shake off control by the _[[Possession]]_ spell).
