# Veil of Privacy
![[icons-environment-settlement-lighthouse-rock-red.webp|150]]

You erect protective wards that make the target difficult to detect via magic. _Veil of privacy_ attempts to counteract all detection, revelation, and scrying effects used against the target or the target's gear throughout the duration, counting cantrips as 1st-rank spells for this purpose. Successfully counteracting a spell that targets an area or multiple targets negates the effects for only _veil of privacy's_ target.
