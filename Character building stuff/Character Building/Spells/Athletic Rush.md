![[icons-magic-control-buff-strength-muscle-damage.webp|150]]

Your body fills with physical power and skill. You gain a +10-foot status bonus to Speed and a +2 status bonus to Athletics checks. As a part of Casting this Spell, you can use a Stride, Leap, Climb, or Swim action. The spell's bonuses apply during that action.
