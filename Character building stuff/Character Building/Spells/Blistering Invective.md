# Blistering Invective
![[icons-magic-fire-flame-burning-skeleton-explosion.webp|150]]

A heap of insults and invectives spew from your mouth-words so devastating your foes burn from the intensity of your diatribe. Your words deal 2d6 persistent,fire damage, and the target must attempt a Will save. If the target doesn't understand the language or you're not speaking a language, it gains a +4 circumstance bonus to its save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target takes half the persistent fire damage.

**Failure** The target becomes [[Frightened|Frightened 1]] and takes the full persistent fire damage.

**Critical Failure** The target becomes [[Frightened|Frightened 2]] and takes double the persistent fire damage.

* * *

**Heightened (+2)** You can target two additional creatures, and the persistent damage increases by 2d6.
