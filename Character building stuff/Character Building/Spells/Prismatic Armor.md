# Prismatic Armor
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-prismatic-armor.webp|150]]

You wrap the target in armor made of multicolored light. It functions as _[[Chromatic Armor]]_ that is all colors (granting resistance 5 to acid, electricity, fire, force, mental, poison, and sonic). An attacker that critically fails on its saving throw against the spell is [[Blinded]] rather than [[Dazzled]].

**Heightened (9th)** The resistances increase to 10 each.
