# Heart's Desire
![[icons-commodities-treasure-crown-gold-satin-gems-red.webp|150]]

You surround your target with wondrous illusions of their greatest desires, which distract them from reality. The target must attempt a Will save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target disbelieves the illusion and is unaffected.

**Success** For 1 round, the target is [[Stupefied|Stupefied 2]] and takes a -2 status penalty to any checks it makes to determine the effects of reactions.

**Failure** For 1 minute, the target is [[Stupefied|Stupefied 2]] and can't use reactions.

**Critical Failure** As failure, and all spaces are difficult terrain for the target.

* * *

**Heightened (+2)** You can target one additional creature.
