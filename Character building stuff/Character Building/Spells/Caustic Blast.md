# Caustic Blast
![[icons-magic-acid-orb-bubble-smoke-drip.webp|150]]

You fling a large glob of acid that immediately detonates, spraying nearby creatures. Creatures in the area take 1d8 acid damage with a basic Reflex save; on a critical failure, the creature also takes 1 persistent acid damage.

* * *

**Heightened (+2)** The initial damage increases by 1d8, and the persistent damage on a critical failure increases by 1.
