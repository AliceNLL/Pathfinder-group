# Disappearance
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-disapperance.webp|150]]

You shroud a creature from others' senses. The target becomes [[Undetected]], not just to sight but to all senses, allowing the target to count as [[Invisible]] no matter what precise and imprecise senses an observer might have. It's still possible for a creature to find the target by Seeking, looking for disturbed dust, hearing gaps in the sound spectrum, or finding some other way to discover the presence of an otherwise-undetectable creature.
