# Chilling Darkness
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-chilling-darkness.webp|150]]

You shoot an utterly cold ray of darkness tinged with unholy energy. Make a ranged spell attack. The ray deals 5d6 cold damage. If the target has the holy trait, you deal an extra 5d6 spirit damage.

If the ray passes through an area of magical light or targets a creature affected by magical light, chilling darkness attempts to counteract the light. If you need to determine whether the ray passes through an area of light, draw a line between yourself and the spell's target.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target takes double damage.

**Success** The target takes full damage.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The cold damage increases by 2d6, and the spirit damage against holy creatures increases by 2d6.
