# Fashionista
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-fasionista.webp|150]]

The target's clothes are transformed into ostentatious attire that epitomizes high-end local fashion. No details of the target's appearance transform other than their clothes, so their weapons or armor remain unchanged in appearance. The target gains a +1 status bonus on Deception checks to [[Create a Diversion]]. You can Dismiss this spell. At the end of the spell's duration, the target's clothes revert to their original appearance.

* * *

**Heightened (+2)** The status bonus increases by 1, to a maximum of +4 at 7th level.
