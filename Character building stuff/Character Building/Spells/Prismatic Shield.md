# Prismatic Shield
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-prismatic-shield.webp|150]]

Shield-sized shards of multicolored light manifest in the air around you, each rotating quickly to intercept attacks.

Melee attacks against you impact a randomly colored shard, subjecting the attacker to a random effect from _[[Prismatic Spray]]_, with a saving throw of the type indicated in that spell.

The shards automatically block physical ranged attacks the size of a spear or smaller, such as arrows, bolts, and javelins. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your AC against attacks with larger ranged weapons.

Any spell that targets you requires the caster to succeed at a counteract check against your spell DC, or it fails to affect you.
