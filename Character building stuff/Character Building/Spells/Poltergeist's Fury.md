# Poltergeist's Fury
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-poltergeists-fury.webp|150]]

Your fury spills over in a telekinetic storm of terrifying proportions. Any loose, unattended objects of 1 Bulk or less within range are picked up and begin to orbit you at breathtaking speeds. All creatures in the area take 6d4 piercing damage with a basic Reflex save. Each time you Sustain the Spell, you can increase the radius of the storm by 10 feet, to a maximum of 100 feet. The storm moves with you and provides you with lesser cover, though you can't use this cover to Hide or [[Sneak]]. Allies within the storm who roll a success on their Reflex save against your poltergeist's fury get a critical success instead, as you attempt to avoid hitting them.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d4.
