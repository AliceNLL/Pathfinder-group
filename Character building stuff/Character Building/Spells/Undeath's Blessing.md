# Undeath's Blessing
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-undeaths-blessing.webp|150]]

You instill within a creature the touch of the grave. For the duration, _[[Harm]]_ and _[[Heal]]_ spells treat the creature as undead. In addition, harm spells gain a +2 status bonus to the Hit Points restored to the target.

If the target wishes to avoid the spell, it can attempt a Will save to reduce the effects.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target heals half as much from _heal_ and takes half as much damage from _harm_ for 1 round.

**Failure** Effects as described in the text.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The status bonus to the Hit Points restored increases by 2.
