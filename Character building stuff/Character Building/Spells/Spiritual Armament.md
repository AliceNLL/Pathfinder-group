# Spiritual Armament
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-spiritual-weapon.webp|150]]

You create a ghostly, magical echo of one weapon you're wielding or wearing and fling it. Attempt a spell attack roll against the target's AC, dealing 2d8 damage on a hit (or double damage on a critical hit). The damage type is the same as the chosen weapon (or any of its types for a versatile weapon). The attack deals spirit damage instead if that would be more detrimental to the creature (as determined by the GM). This attack uses and contributes to your multiple attack penalty. After the attack, the weapon returns to your side. If you sanctify the spell, the attacks are sanctified as well. Each time you Sustain the spell, you can repeat the attack against any creature within 120 feet.
