# Lucky Number
![[icons-sundries-gaming-dice-pair-white-green.webp|150]]

When you Cast this Spell, roll 1d20 and make a note of the result. You gain the [[That's My Number]] reaction; once you use the reaction, the spell ends, and you become temporarily immune to _lucky number_ until the next time you make your daily preparations.
