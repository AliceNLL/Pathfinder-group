# Ghostly Weapon
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-ghostly-weapon.webp|150]]

The target weapon becomes translucent and ghostly, and it can affect material and incorporeal creatures and objects. It gains the effects of the _ghost touch_ property rune, meaning it is magical if it wasn't already, is especially effective against incorporeal creatures, and can be wielded by a corporeal or incorporeal creature.
