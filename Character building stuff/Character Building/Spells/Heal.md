# Heal
![[icons-magic-life-cross-worn-green.webp|150]]

You channel vital energy to heal the living or damage the undead. If the target is a willing living creature, you restore 1d8 Hit Points. If the target is undead, you deal that amount of vitality damage to it, and it gets a basic Fortitude save. The number of actions you spend when Casting this Spell determines its targets, range, area, and other parameters.

1 The spell has a range of touch.

2 **(concentrate)** The spell has a range of 30 feet. If you're healing a living creature, increase the Hit Points restored by 8.

3 **(concentrate)** You disperse vital energy in a 30 foot emanation. This targets all living and undead creatures in the burst.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The amount of healing or damage increases by 1d8, and the extra healing for the 2-action version increases by 8.
