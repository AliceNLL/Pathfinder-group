# Dance of Darkness
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-dance-of-darkness.webp|150]]

You dance, [[Stride|Striding]] up to half your Speed. At either the start or end of your Stride, you create an area of magical darkness in a 10-foot burst centered on your location. This area is filled with magical darkness that works the same way as that created by a _[[Darkness]]_ spell of the same level. When you create the darkness, attempt a Performance check to dance, with a standard DC for your level, to determine the duration of the darkness.
