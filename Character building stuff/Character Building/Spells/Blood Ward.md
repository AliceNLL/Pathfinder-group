![[icons-skills-wounds-blood-cells-vessel-red-orange.webp|150]]

Your patronâ€™s aegis descends to shield a target from harm. Designate one of the following creature traits: aberration, animal, beast, celestial, construct, dragon, elemental, fey, fiend, fungus, monitor, ooze, plant, or undead. The target gains a +1 status bonus to its saving throws and AC against creatures with that trait.

* * *

**Heightened (5th)** The status bonus increases to +2.
