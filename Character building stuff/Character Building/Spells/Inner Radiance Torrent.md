# Inner Radiance Torrent
![[icons-magic-fire-beam-jet-stream-embers.webp|150]]

You gradually manifest your spiritual energy into your cupped hands before firing off a storm of bolts and beams that deal 4d4 force damage to all creatures in a 60-foot line. Creatures in the area must attempt a basic Reflex save. On a critical failure, they're also blinded for 1 round. The number of actions you spend when Casting this Spell determines the area. If the line passes through an area of magical darkness or targets a creature affected by magical darkness, _inner radiance torrent_ attempts to counteract the darkness.

2 **(somatic, verbal)** The line is 60 feet long.

3 **(material, somatic, verbal)** The line is 120 foot line{120 feet} long.

**Two Rounds** The line is 120 feet long. If you spend 3 actions casting the spell, you can avoid finishing the spell and spend another 3 actions on your next turn to empower the spell even further. If you choose to do so, the damage dealt by this spell increases by 4d4, and you enter a shining state for 1 minute, causing you to glow with light and deal 1 force damage to creatures that end their turn adjacent to you.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The initial damage, as well as the additional damage for the 2-round casting time, each increase by 4d4, and the damage to adjacent creatures dealt while in your shining state increases by 1.
