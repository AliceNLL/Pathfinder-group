# Tempest Touch
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-tempest-touch.webp|150]]

Your touch calls forth a churning mass of icy water that clings to your target, dealing 1d4 bludgeoning damage and 1d4 cold damage. The target must attempt a Fortitude save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target takes half damage and a -5-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds until the end of your next turn.

**Failure** The target takes full damage and a -10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds until the end of your next turn.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target takes double damage.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The bludgeoning and cold damage each increase by 1d4.
