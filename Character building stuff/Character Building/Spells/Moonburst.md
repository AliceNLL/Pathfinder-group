A powerful globe of chilling moonlight explodes in the area, dealing 8d10 cold damage to creatures and objects in the area, plus 8d10 vitality additional damage to undead creatures.

_Moonburst_'s cold damage is silver damage for the purposes of weaknesses, resistances, and the like. Each creature and object in the area must attempt a Reflex save.

**Critical Success** The creature or object is unaffected.

**Success** The creature or object takes half damage.
