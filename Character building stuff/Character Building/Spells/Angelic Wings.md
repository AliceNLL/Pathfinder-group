Wings of pure light spread out from your back, granting you a fly Speed equal to your Speed. Your wings cast bright light in a 30-foot radius. When this spell's duration would end, if you're still flying, you float to the ground, as _[[Gentle Landing]]_.

**Heightened (5th)** The duration increases to 1 minute.
