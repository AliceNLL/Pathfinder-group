# Paralyze
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-paralyze.webp|150]]

You block the target's motor impulses before they can leave its mind, threatening to freeze the target in place. The target must attempt a Will save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target is [[Stunned 1]].

**Failure** The target is [[Paralyzed]] for 1 round.

**Critical Failure** The target is Paralyzed for 4 rounds. At the end of each of its turns, it can attempt a new Will save to reduce the remaining duration by 1 round, or end it entirely on a critical success.
