# Blinding Fury
![[icons-magic-fire-flame-burning-eye.webp|150]]

**Trigger** A creature damages you.

* * *

You curse the target with your outrage at being attacked. The effect is determined by the target's Will save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target can't [[Observed|Observe]] you until the end of its turn, and if you're currently Observed by it, you become [[Hidden]] to it.

**Failure** As success, and for 1 minute, every time the target damages you, it can't Observe you until the end of its turn.

**Critical Failure** As success, and for an unlimited duration, the first time each round the target damages a creature, it can't Observe that creature until the end of its turn. If it damages several creatures at once, the creature it can't perceive is chosen randomly among those creatures.
