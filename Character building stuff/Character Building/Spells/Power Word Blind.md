You utter an arcane word of power that can make the target [[Blinded]] upon hearing it. Once targeted, the target is then temporarily immune for 10 minutes. The effect of the spell depends on the target's level.

**11th or Lower** The target is Blinded permanently.

**12th-13th** The target is Blinded for 1d4 minutes.

**14th or Higher** The target is [[Dazzled]] for 1 minute.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The levels at which each outcome applies increase by 2.
