# Font of Serenity
![[icons-magic-light-explosion-star-glow-orange.webp|150]]

A divine beacon radiates serenity, soothing nearby allies.

Allies within the area gain a +1 status bonus to saving throws against emotion effects.

An ally can touch the font as an Interact action; if they do so, the spell attempts to counteract one emotion effect affecting the ally of the ally's choice, after which that emotion effect is temporarily immune for 1 day. If the spell succeeds at the counteract check, it removes the emotion effect from your ally, though not from any other creatures the effect might be affecting.

* * *

**Heightened (+4)** The bonus increases by 1.
