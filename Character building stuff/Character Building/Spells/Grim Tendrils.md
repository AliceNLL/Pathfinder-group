# Grim Tendrils
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-grim-tendrils.webp|150]]

Tendrils of darkness curl out from your fingertips and race through the air. You deal 2d4 void damage and 1 bleed damage to living creatures in the line. Each living creature in the line must attempt a Fortitude save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature takes half the void damage and no persistent bleed damage.

**Failure** The creature takes full damage.

**Critical Failure** The creature takes double void damage and double persistent bleed damage.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The void damage increases by 2d4, and the persistent bleed damage increases by 1.
