# Fey Glamour
![[icons-creatures-fish-fish-fangtooth-skeletal-pink.webp|150]]

You call upon fey glamours to cloak an area or the targets in illusion. This has the effect of either _[[Illusory Scene]]_ on the area or _[[Illusory Disguise]]_ on the creatures, as if heightened to a level 1 level lower than fey glamour, using fey glamour's range and duration.
