![[icons-creatures-unholy-demon-fire-horned-winged-roar.webp|150]]

You create a churning eddy of warm air that makes it difficult to fly within the area. This area is difficult terrain for flying creatures. Each time a flying creature enters the area or ends its turn there, it must attempt an Acrobatics check to [[Maneuver in Flight]].

**Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Failure** The creature descends 30 feet.

**Critical Failure** The creature descends 60 feet.

* * *

**Heightened (4th)** The duration increases to 10 minutes.
