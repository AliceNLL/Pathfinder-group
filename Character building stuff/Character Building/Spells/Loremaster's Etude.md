![[icons-sundries-books-book-tooled-brass-brown.webp|150]]

**Trigger** You or an ally within range attempts a skill check to Recall Knowledge

* * *

You call upon your muse's deep mysteries, granting the target a greater ability to think and recall information. Roll the triggering Recall Knowledge skill check twice and use the higher result.
