# Celestial Brand
![[icons-magic-fire-barrier-wall-flame-ring-yellow.webp|150]]

A blazing symbol appears on the target, cursing it to face divine justice. You and your allies receive a +1 status bonus to your attack rolls and skill checks against it.

Anytime a good creature damages it, the good creature deals an additional 1d4 spirit damage. The target is then temporarily immune for 1 minute.

* * *

**Heightened (+2)** The spirit damage increases by 1.
