Devil horns grow from your skull, and your skin takes on features of the devil responsible for your diabolic bloodline. You gain resistance 5 to fire, poison, and unholy, and resistance 1 to physical damage (except silver). You gain weakness 5 to holy.

* * *

**Heightened (+2)** The resistance to fire, poison, and unholy increases by 5, the resistance to physical damage (except silver) by 2, and the weakness to holy by 5.
