# Illuminate
![[icons-sundries-lights-candle-lit-yellow.webp|150]]

You light all non-magical light sources in the area that use fire to provide their lightâ€”such as candles, lamps, and sconces. You can choose to make the emanation smaller than its maximum, to any distance of your choice. If a light source is attended by an unwilling creature, that creature can attempt a Reflex save to snuff the light out before it becomes noticeable.

**Heightened (+1)** The maximum area increases by 10 feet.
