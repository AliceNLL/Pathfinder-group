# Roar of the Wyrm
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-roar-of-the-wyrm.webp|150]]

You channel the might of dragons into your voice, letting out a roar that engenders respect in dragonkind but that instills fear in most other creatures.

The impressive roar grants you a  for 10 minutes against dragons that were in the area at the time of casting. All enemies within the area other than dragons must attempt a Will save; to these enemies, _roar of the wyrm_ is a fear effect.

_Roar of the wyrm_ affects non-dragon creatures with deep ties to dragonkind (such as a barbarian with the draconic instinct, a sorcerer with the draconic bloodline, or a member of a culture that reveres dragons) as if they had the dragon trait. The GM decides if a creature is aligned enough with dragonkind to be affected in this way.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature is [[Frightened|Frightened 1]].

**Failure** The creature is [[Frightened|Frightened 2]].

**Critical Failure** The creature is [[Frightened|Frightened 3]] and [[Fleeing]] for 1 round.
