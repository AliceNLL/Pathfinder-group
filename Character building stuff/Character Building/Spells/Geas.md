# Geas
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-geas.webp|150]]

You enforce a magic rule on a willing target, forcing it to either perform or refrain from carrying out a certain act. A _geas_ to perform an act is usually conditional, such as, "Always offer hospitality to strangers seeking a place to stay." An unconditional _geas_ to perform a certain act doesn't require the target to perform that act exclusively, though it must prioritize the task above all leisurely pursuits. The most common _geas_ to refrain from carrying out an act is a specification to avoid violating a contract. In those cases, the secondary caster usually takes charge of making sure the wording of the contract is attuned correctly with the ritual's magic. Because the target is willing, _geas_ can have a duration that lasts for as long as the target agrees to. If the target is unable to fulfill the _geas_, it becomes [[Sickened 1]], and the sickened condition increases by 1 for each consecutive day it is prevented from following the _geas_, to a maximum of sickened 4. The sickened condition ends immediately when it follows the _geas_ again; it can't remove the sickened condition in any other way. Only powerful magic such as a _[[Wish]]_ ritual can remove the effects of _geas_ from a willing target.

**Critical Success** The _geas_ succeeds, and the target receives a +1 status bonus to skill checks that directly uphold the _geas_ (at the GM's discretion).

**Success** The _geas_ succeeds.

**Failure** The _geas_ fails.

**Critical Failure** The _geas_ fails, and you are instead affected by the _geas_ you were attempting to place on the target. You are considered an unwilling target, so the _geas_ can be counteracted with a _cleanse affliction_ spell.

**Heightened (5th)** You can use _geas_ on an unwilling creature; it can attempt a Will save to negate the effect. If the target fails this Will save, the _geas_ lasts up to 1 week. A _cleanse affliction_ spell can counteract a _geas_ on an unwilling creature, in addition to powerful magic such as a _wish_ ritual. A clever unwilling creature can subvert the _geas_ by contriving situations that prevent it from complying, but in that case it becomes [[Sickened 1|Sickened]] (as described above).

**Heightened (7th)** As 5th level, but the _geas_ lasts for up to 1 year on an unwilling creature.

**Heightened (9th)** As 5th level, but the _geas_ lasts for a duration you choose (even unlimited) on an unwilling creature.
