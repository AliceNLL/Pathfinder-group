You manipulate the target's emotions, potentially allowing you to control it for a brief instant. The target must attempt a Will save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target is [[Stunned 1]].

**Failure** On the target's next turn, it's [[Stunned 1]] and you partially control it, causing it to take a single action of your choice. If it has actions left, it can act normally.

**Critical Failure** The target is [[Controlled]] for 1 round.

* * *

**Heightened (7th)** On a failure, the target is Controlled for 1 round. On a critical failure, the target is Controlled for up to 1 minute; it receives a new Will save at the end of each of its turns, and on a success, the spell ends.
