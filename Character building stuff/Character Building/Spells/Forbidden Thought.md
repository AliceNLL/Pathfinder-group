# Forbidden Thought
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-forbidden-thought.webp|150]]

You place a psychic lock in a foe's mind that prevents it from a specific action. Choose "Strike," "Stride," "Cast a Spell," or a specific action you know the creature to have (such as "Breath Weapon" against a dragon). If the creature attempts that action on its next turn, it must surmount your lock to do so, causing it to take 2d6 mental damage (with a basic Will save). The target is then temporarily immune for 1 minute.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d6.

* * *

**Amp** Your telepathic push is particularly shocking to those who resist it. If the target fails its save, it's also [[Stunned 1]].
