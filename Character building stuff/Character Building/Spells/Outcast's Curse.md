# Outcast's Curse
![[icons-creatures-slimes-slime-face-melting-green.webp|150]]

You afflict the target with a curse that makes its presence abrasive and off-putting. The target must attempt a Will save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** For 10 minutes, the target must roll twice and use the worse result whenever attempting a Deception, Diplomacy, Intimidation, or Performance check, and creatures they encounter have an initial attitude toward them of one step worse (for instance, [[Unfriendly]] instead of [[Indifferent]]).

**Failure** As success, but the effect is permanent.

**Critical Failure** As failure, and creatures that the target encounters have an initial attitude toward them of two steps worse.
