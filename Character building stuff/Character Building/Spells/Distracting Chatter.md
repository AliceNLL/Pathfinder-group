# Distracting Chatter
![[icons-creatures-abilities-mouth-teeth-human.webp|150]]

You bombard a target with distracting auditory illusions, surrounding them with a tumultuous cacophony of overlapping speech, whispers, screams, and muttering. The target is [[Off-Guard]], takes a -2 status penalty to purely auditory Perception checks, and must succeed at a DC 5 flat or the attempt fails. The duration depends on the target's Will save.

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The duration is 1 round.

**Failure** The duration is 3 rounds.

**Critical Failure** The duration is 1 minute.

* * *

**Heightened (7th)** You can target up to five creatures.
