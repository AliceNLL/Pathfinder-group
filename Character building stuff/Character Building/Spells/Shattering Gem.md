# Shattering Gem
![[icons-magic-lightning-barrier-shield-orb-pink.webp|150]]

A large gem floats around the target in an erratic pattern. The gem has 5 Hit Points. Each time a creature Strikes the target, the target attempts a DC 11 flat. On a success, the gem blocks the attack, so the attack first damages the gem and then applies any remaining damage to the target. If the gem is reduced to 0 Hit Points, it shatters, immediately dealing the creature that destroyed it 1d8 slashing damage (basic Reflex save), as long as that creature is within 10 feet of the target.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The gem has 5 additional HP, and the damage dealt by its detonation increases by 1d8.
