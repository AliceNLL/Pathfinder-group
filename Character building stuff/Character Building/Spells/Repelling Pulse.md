# Repelling Pulse
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-repelling-pulse.webp|150]]

You unleash a powerful pulse of telekinetic power, and the pulse violently hurls creatures away from you. Each creature in the area takes 7d10 force damage depending on its Reflex save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature takes half damage.

**Failure** The creature takes full damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you.

**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage. The creature is pushed 20 feet away from you and is then knocked [[Prone]].

* * *

**Heightened (+2)** The force damage increases by 2d10, and the distance the target is moved on a failure and critical failure increases by 5 feet.
