# Impart Empathy
![[icons-skills-social-peace-luck-insult.webp|150]]

You expand the target's ability to understand social cues that are normally beyond its comprehension. Any creature to which the target isn't unfriendly or hostile can use Diplomacy to [[Make an Impression]] on it and to make very simple Requests of it. This doesn't render the animal any more inclined to help than it otherwise would be.

**Heightened (4th)** The spell can also target plants and fungi.
