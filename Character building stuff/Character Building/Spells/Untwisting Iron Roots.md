# Untwisting Iron Roots
![[icons-magic-earth-barrier-stone-explosion-debris.webp|150]]

You manipulate the earth beneath your feet to throw your enemies off balance, leaving chunks of rock and rubble behind. Creatures within range take 2d6 bludgeoning damage, with a basic Reflex save; on a failed save, they also fall [[Prone]]. The affected area becomes difficult terrain, but you can move through the difficult terrain normally.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d6.
