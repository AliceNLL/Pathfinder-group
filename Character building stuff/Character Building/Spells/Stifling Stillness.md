# Stifling Stillness
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-stifling-stillness.webp|150]]

You make all air in the target area unnaturally still and unyielding, creating a shimmering haze. The stagnant, heavy air becomes an area of difficult terrain. Creatures in the area that breathe air and aren't holding their breath must spend a single action on their turn straining to breathe the stagnant air; once they do, they still mostly breathe their own exhaled air, taking 3d6 poison damage (basic Fortitude save) and becoming [[Fatigued]].

* * *

**Heightened (+2)** The damage increases by 3d6.
