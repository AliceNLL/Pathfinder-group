# Stormwind Flight
![[icons-commodities-materials-feather-blue-glowing.webp|150]]

Powerful winds carry you smoothly through the air, giving you a fly Speed equal to your Speed. When this spell's duration would end, if you're still flying, you float to the ground, as _[[Gentle Landing]]_.

* * *

**Heightened (6th)** When you fly using _stormwind flight_, you ignore difficult terrain from wind.
