![[icons-creatures-claws-claw-hooked-barbed.webp|150]]

Vicious claws grow from your fingers. They are finesse unarmed attacks that deal 1d4 slashing damage and 1d6 extra damage of a type determined by the dragon in your bloodline.

Your scales from blood magic glow with faint energy, giving you resistance 5 to the same damage type.

* * *

**Heightened (5th)** The extra damage increases to 2d6, and the resistance increases to 10.

**Heightened (9th)** The extra damage increases to 3d6, and the resistance increases to 15.
