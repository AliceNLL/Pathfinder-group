# Earthquake
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-earthquake.webp|150]]

You shake the ground, topple creatures into fissures, and collapse structures. The GM might add additional effects in certain areas. Cliffs might collapse, causing creatures to fall, or a lake might drain as fissures open up below its surface, leaving a morass of quicksand.

*   **Shaking Ground** The ground is difficult terrain, and creatures on it take a -2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls, AC, and skill checks.
*   **Fissures** Each creature on the ground must attempt a Reflex save at the start of its turn to keep its footing and avoid falling into 40-foot-deep fissures that open beneath it. The fissures are permanent, and their sides require successful DC 15 athletics to Climb.
*   **Collapse Structures** and ceilings might collapse. The GM rolls a flat check for each (DC 16 flat for a shoddy structure, all adjusted higher or lower as the GM sees fit). A collapse deals 11d6 bludgeoning damage to each creature caught in it with a basic Reflex save. A creature falls [[Prone]] unless it critically succeeds and falls into a fissure if it critically fails.

* * *

**Heightened (10th)** You create a massive earthquake that can devastate a settlement. The range increases to half a mile and the area to a quarter-mile burst.
