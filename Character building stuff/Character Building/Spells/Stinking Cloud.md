# Stinking Cloud
![[icons-creatures-slimes-slime-movement-splash-green.webp|150]]

You create a cloud of putrid mist in the area. The cloud functions as _[[Mist]]_ except it sickens creatures that end their turns within the cloud. (The [[Concealed]] condition is not a poison effect.)

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature is [[Sickened 1]].

**Failure** The creature is [[Sickened 1]] and [[Slowed]] while in the cloud.

**Critical Failure** The creature is [[Sickened 1|Sickened 2]] and [[Slowed]] until it leaves the cloud.
