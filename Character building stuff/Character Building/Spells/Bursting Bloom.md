# Bursting Bloom
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-bursting-bloom.webp|150]]

You cause a rose bush to sprout from the chest of a foe, bursting out of its body and wrapping it in thorned vines. The target takes 6d6 piercing damage and 1d6 persistent,bleed damage and must attempt a Fortitude save. When the target is no longer taking persistent bleed damage and is no longer encumbered, the rose bush withers away to nothing.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature takes half damage and no persistent damage.

**Failure** The creature takes full damage and persistent damage and is [[Encumbered]] for 4 rounds.

**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage and persistent damage and is encumbered for 1 minute.

* * *

**Heightened (+2)** The initial damage increases by 3d6, and the persistent bleed damage increases by 1d6.
