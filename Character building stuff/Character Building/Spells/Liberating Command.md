# Liberating Command
![[icons-magic-control-debuff-chains-shackle-movement-red.webp|150]]

You call out a liberating cry, urging an ally to break free of an effect that holds them in place. If the target is [[Grabbed]], [[Immobilized]], or [[Restrained]], it can immediately use a reaction to attempt to [[Escape]].
