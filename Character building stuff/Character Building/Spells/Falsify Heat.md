You veil the signs of the fires of vitality, altering the target's apparent body temperature. This illusion applies to all senses, and a creature that touches the target can attempt to disbelieve the illusion. You can Dismiss the spell. Choose an illusory body temperature when you cast the spell.

*   **Moderate** The target's body temperature appears the same as the surrounding environment, giving the target a +2 circumstance bonus to Deception checks to Impersonate an undead, a cold-blooded creature, or an inanimate object (such as a corpse). The target is also [[Invisible]] to heatvision and other abilities that sense heat similarly.
