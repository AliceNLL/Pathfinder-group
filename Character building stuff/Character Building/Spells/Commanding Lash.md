# Commanding Lash
![[icons-weapons-misc-whip-red-yellow.webp|150]]

With the threat of more pain, you compel a creature you've recently harmed. You issue a command to the target, with the effects of the spell _[[Command]]_.If the target is [[Frightened]], [[Stupefied]], or taking persistent damage, it takes a â€“2 circumstance penalty to the save. Regardless of the result, the target is then temporarily immune for 1 hour
