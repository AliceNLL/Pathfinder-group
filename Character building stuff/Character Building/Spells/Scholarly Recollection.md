**Trigger** You attempt a Perception check to Seek, or you attempt a skill check to Recall Knowledge with a skill you're trained in.

Speaking a short prayer as you gather your thoughts, you're blessed to find yourself pointed in the right direction. The GM rolls the triggering check twice and uses the better result.
