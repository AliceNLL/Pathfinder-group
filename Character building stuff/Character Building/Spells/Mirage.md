# Mirage
![[icons-environment-wilderness-cave-entrance-vulcano.webp|150]]

You create an illusion that causes natural terrain to look, sound, feel, and smell like a different kind of terrain. This doesn't disguise any structures or creatures in the area.

Any creature that touches the illusion or uses the [[Seek]] action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve your illusion.

**Heightened (5th)** Your image can also disguise structures or create illusory structures (but still doesn't disguise creatures).
