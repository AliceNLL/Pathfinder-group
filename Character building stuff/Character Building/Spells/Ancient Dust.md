# Ancient Dust
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-glitterdust.webp|150]]

You cough up a cloud of gray soil, echoing the dust in the graves of Kemnebi's many victims. Each creature in the area takes void damage equal to your spellcasting modifier and 1 persistent void damage depending on its Fortitude save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature takes half damage and no persistent damage.

**Failure** The creature takes full damage and persistent damage.

**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage and double the persistent damage.

* * *

**Heightened (+2)** The initial void damage increases by 1d6, and the persistent damage increases by 1.
