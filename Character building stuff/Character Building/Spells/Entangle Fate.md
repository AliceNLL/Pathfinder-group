# Entangle Fate
![[icons-magic-control-debuff-energy-snare-purple-pink.webp|150]]

You cause a swirl of energy to entangle the fates of all caught within the blast. Each creature in the area must attempt a Will save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature's fate becomes distorted, and momentary conflicting glimpses of the immediate future cause the creature to become [[Off-Guard]] until the start of its next turn.

**Failure** As success, but the creature is off-guard for the duration of the spell. If more than one of the targets failed to resist this spell, the creature also becomes [[Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] for the duration of the spell as its fate and those of the other creatures continue to clash and strain against each other.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but any creature that becomes stupefied 1 for the duration of the spell also becomes [[Enfeebled 1]] and [[Clumsy 1]] for the spell's duration.
