# Invisibility
![[icons-creatures-magical-construct-stone-earth-gray.webp|150]]

Illusions bend light around the target, rendering it [[Invisible]]. This makes it [[Undetected]] to all creatures, though the creatures can attempt to find the target, making it [[Hidden]] to them instead. If the target uses a hostile action, the spell ends after that hostile action is completed.

* * *

**Heightened (4th)** The spell lasts 1 minute, but it doesn't end if the target uses a hostile action.
