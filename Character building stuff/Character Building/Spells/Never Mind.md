# Never Mind
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-feeblemind.webp|150]]

You drastically reduce the target's mental faculties. The target must attempt a Will save. The effects of this curse can be removed only through effects that target curses.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target is [[Stupefied|Stupefied 2]] for 1 round.

**Failure** The target is [[Stupefied|Stupefied 4]] with an unlimited duration.

**Critical Failure** The target's intellect is permanently reduced below that of an animal, and it treats its Charisma, Intelligence, and Wisdom modifiers as â€“5. It loses all class abilities that require mental faculties, including all spellcasting. If the target is a PC, they become an NPC under the GM's control.
