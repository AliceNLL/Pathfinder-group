# Tattoo Whispers
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-tattoo-whispers.webp|150]]

You carefully tattoo the same design upon each secondary caster. The tattoo can be of any shape or symbol, but it must include a mouth. The tattoo fades naturally over the course of 1 month.

* * *

**Critical Success** The tattoos on the secondary casters are all magically linked for 1 week, providing a semi-telepathic bond. Each secondary caster can communicate secretly with any other secondary casters at any time by mouthing words but making no sound. The person receiving a message must be within 120 feet of the sender, must be within the sender's line of sight, and must have their tattoo uncovered. The mouth of the tattoo moves to match the words, which the tattoo whispers, but only the tattoo's bearer can hear it.

**Success** As critical success, but the effect lasts for 1 day.

**Failure** The ritual has no effect.

**Critical Failure** The ritual has no effect and creates a backlash of persistent mental static. All casters are [[Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] for 1 day.
