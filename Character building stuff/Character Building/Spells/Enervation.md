# Enervation
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-enervation.webp|150]]

Extending a finger, you fire a beam of void energy that weakens the life force of any creature it touches. Each living creature in the line must attempt a Fortitude save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature takes 2d8 persistent,void damage.

**Failure** The creature takes 4d8 persistent,void damage and becomes [[Drained 1]].

**Critical Failure** The creature takes 4d8 persistent,void damage and becomes [[Drained 1|Drained 2]] and [[Doomed|Doomed 1]].

* * *

**Heightened (+2)** The persistent void damage increases by 1d8 persistent,void damage on a success, or by 2d8 persistent,void damage on a failure or critical failure.
