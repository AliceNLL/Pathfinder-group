![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-eat-fire.webp|150]]

**Trigger** You would take fire damage.

* * *

You consume and ingest fire, making it less harmful to you. You gain resistance 5 to fire damage until the end of the current turn. During the remaining duration of the spell, you can use the Belch Smoke action. The spell ends if you fall [[Unconscious]], inhale, or exhale (this includes speaking).

**Belch Smoke** 1 You exhale what remains of the smoke, ending the spell and creating a smoke cloud in a 5 foot burst within 20 feet. All creatures within the smoke cloud are [[Concealed]], and all other creatures are concealed to them. The smoke lasts for 1 minute or until dispersed by a strong wind.

* * *

**Heightened (+3)** The resistance increases by 5.
