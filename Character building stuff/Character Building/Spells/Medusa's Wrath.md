# Medusa's Wrath
![[icons-magic-defensive-armor-stone-skin.webp|150]]

You make an attack filled with a medusa's petrifying power. Make an unarmed Strike with the following additional effects.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is [[Slowed|Slowed 2]] and must attempt a Fortitude save at the end of each of its turns; this ongoing save has the incapacitation trait.

On a failed save, the Slowed condition increases by 1 (2 on a critical failure). A successful save reduces the Slowed condition by 1. When a creature is unable to act due to the Slowed condition from medusa's wrath, it is [[Petrified]] permanently. The spell ends if the creature is Petrified or the Slowed condition is removed.

**Success** As critical success, but the target is initially [[Slowed]].
