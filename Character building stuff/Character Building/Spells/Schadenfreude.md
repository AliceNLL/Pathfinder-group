**Trigger** You critically fail a saving throw against a foe's effect.

You distract your enemy with their feeling of smug pleasure when you fail catastrophically. They must attempt a Will save.

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature is distracted by its amusement and takes a -1 status penalty on Perception checks and Will saves for 1 round. 

**Failure** The creature is overcome by its amusement and is [[Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] for 1 round.

**Critical Failure** The creature is lost in its amusement and is [[Stupefied|Stupefied 2]] for 1 round and [[Stunned 1]].
