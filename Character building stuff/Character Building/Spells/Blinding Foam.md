# Blinding Foam
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-blinding-foam.webp|150]]

You spray a colorful, caustic foam into the target's eyes, which clings to their face. Make a spell attack roll. If you hit, you deal 5d10 acid damage and 1d6 persistent,acid damage, and the target is [[Blinded]] for the duration. The foam can be removed with 3 Interact actions, which ends the persistent acid damage. These Interact actions don't need to be consecutive. When the target's persistent acid damage ends, the spell automatically ends.

* * *

**Heightened (8th)** The initial damage increases to 9d10 acid, and the persistent acid damage increases to 2d6 persistent,acid.
