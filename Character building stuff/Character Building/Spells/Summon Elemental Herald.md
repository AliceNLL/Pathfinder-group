# Summon Elemental Herald
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-summon-elemental-herald.webp|150]]

Your meditation into the different elemental planes connects you to them deeply, and this connection allows you to summon a herald of an elemental lord. The herald arrives in the form of a natural disaster centralized on your enemies. The herald occupies the space of a Huge creature. When you Cast this Spell, choose one of the elemental heralds below to summon; if you're a divine spellcaster who worships an elemental lord, you must choose the option matching your deity's element. This spell gains the trait (air, earth, fire, metal, water, or wood) matching your choice.

*   **Air** Speed fly 60 feet; **Arrive**(air) _Supercell Front_ The herald of air arrives in the form of a twisting tornado, with high-speed winds slamming into your enemies. Each enemy in a 100 foot emanation takes 10d8 bludgeoning damage with a basic Fortitude save; **Depart** (air) _Twister Downdraft_ Each enemy in a 60 foot line must attempt a Fortitude save. A creature that fails is knocked [[Prone]] if it's on the ground or descends 40 feet if it's in the air. A creature that descends takes falling damage if this forced movement brings it to the ground.
*   **Earth** Speed 50 feet, burrow 30 feet; **Arrive**(earth) _Tectonic Rise_ The herald of earth erupts from the ground, splitting it open in a 50 foot emanation. Each enemy in the emanation takes 10d6 slashing damage from the flying debris with a basic Reflex save. Enemies who critically fail fall 30 feet into the crevasse, taking falling damage (the sides of the fissure require successful DC 15 athletics. An enemy that critically fails is [[Deafened]] for 10 minutes.
*   **Fire** Speed 60 feet, fly 40 feet; **Arrive**(fire) _Magma Flow_ The herald of fire flows into the area as living magma, dealing 10d6 fire damage and 3d6 persistent,fire damage to all enemies in a 60 foot emanation with a basic Reflex save; **Depart**(fire) _Flame Vortex_ Each enemy in a 60-foot line takes 6d6 fire damage and 3d6 persistent,fire damage with a basic Reflex save as the fire herald whips into a fire pillar before vanishing.
*   **Metal** Speed 50 feet, fly 50 feet; **Arrive**(metal) _Shard Cloud_ The herald of metal arrives as a cloud of metal shards and static electricity, dealing 4d8 slashing damage and 4d12 electricity damage to all enemies in a 50 foot emanation with a basic Reflex save; **Depart**(metal) _Rust Mist_ The shards in the cloud rapidly rust and cling to enemies in the 50 foot emanation, dealing 10d6 damage to metal creatures and objects in the area with a basic Reflex save, ignoring Hardness. Unattended objects automatically critically fail this save.
*   **Water** Speed 40 feet, swim 60 feet; **Arrive**(cold, water) _Hurricane Formation_ The herald of water forms as a miniature hurricane. Each enemy in a 60 foot emanation takes 4d10 bludgeoning damage from the slamming rains and 4d10 cold damage from the falling hail with a basic Fortitude save; **Depart**(cold, water) _Cataclysmic Deluge_ The hurricane collapses into a rushing flood, dealing 6d8 bludgeoning damage to all enemies in a 120 foot cone with a basic Fortitude save. A creature that fails its save is pushed 20 feet away from the herald (or 40 feet on a critical failure).
*   **Wood** Speed 50 feet, burrow 30 feet; **Arrive**(plant, wood) _Advantageous Roots_ The herald of wood bursts forth from the ground as a complex root system. Each enemy in a 50 foot emanation takes 6d10 piercing damage with a basic Reflex save as the roots skewer its limbs and body. Each enemy that fails its save takes a â€“10-foot status penalty to its Speeds until the herald departs; **Depart**(plant, wood) _Retreat to Soil_ The roots retreat into the ground, dealing 6d10 piercing damage to each enemy in a 50 foot emanation with a basic Reflex save. Any creature with a penalty to Speeds from its initial save automatically takes 2d6 persistent,bleed damage. The ground in the emanation is difficult terrain after the roots retreat.
