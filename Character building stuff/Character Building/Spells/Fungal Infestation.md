# Fungal Infestation
![[icons-consumables-mushrooms-umbontae-bumpy-purple.webp|150]]

Toxic spores swarm over creatures in the area, causing them to erupt in grotesque fungal growths. These noxious growths deal 2d6 persistent,poison, and each creature must attempt a Fortitude save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The target takes half the persistent poison damage.

**Failure** The target takes the full persistent poison damage. While it is taking this persistent poison damage, it has weakness 1 to fire and weakness 1 to slashing.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but double the persistent poison damage. While it is taking this persistent poison damage, it has weakness 2 to fire and weakness 2 to slashing.

* * *

**Heightened (+2)** The persistent damage increases by 2d6, and the weakness increases by 1, or by 2 on a critical failure.
