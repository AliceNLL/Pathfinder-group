![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-sanctuary.webp|150]]

You ward a creature with protective energy that deters attacks. Creatures attempting to attack the target must attempt a Will save each time. If the target uses a hostile action, the spell ends.

**Critical Success** _Sanctuary_ ends.

**Success** The creature can attempt its attack and any other attacks against the target this turn.

**Failure** The creature can't attack the target and wastes the action. It can't attempt further attacks against the target this turn.

**Critical Failure** The creature wastes the action and can't attempt to attack the target for the rest of _sanctuary_'s duration.
