# Efficient Apport
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-efficient-apport.webp|150]]

Walking over to an item to pick it up is so much effort. Whether it's your spellbook, a reagent, or a glass of wine, it's simply more efficient to call it to your hand. You teleport the target into your open hand. If you don't have a hand free, it falls to the ground at your feet.
