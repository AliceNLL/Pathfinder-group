# Bralani Referendum
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-bralani-referendum.webp|150]]

You enforce fair play with punishing zephyrs. When you Cast this Spell, choose one condition from among [[Clumsy 1|Clumsy]], [[Drained 1|Drained]], [[Enfeebled 1|Enfeebled]], or [[Stupefied]]. When a creature in the area inflicts the chosen condition, they take 2d6 slashing damage with a basic Fortitude save. A creature can't take this damage more than once per round. You can Dismiss the spell.

* * *

**Heightened (+2)** Choose one more condition. The slashing damage when a creature inflicts any of the chosen conditions increases by 2d6.
