# Sanctified Ground
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-sanctified-ground.webp|150]]

You sanctify the area, sprinkling it with holy water and warding it against your foes. Choose aberrations, celestials, dragons, fiends, monitors, or undead. All creatures in the area gain a +1 status bonus to AC, attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws against the chosen creatures.
