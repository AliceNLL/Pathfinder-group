# Shadow Spy
![[icons-creatures-birds-corvid-call-sound-blue.webp|150]]

You mix blood, soil, and shadow together to form a half-real homunculus in the shape of a crow, sparrow, or other bird. You then command the bird to fly to a location within range and observe all around it. The bird has the statistics of a homunculus, save that it has all of your senses and shares your Perception modifier. Once the spell's duration elapses or upon a trigger you set (which must be fairly simple-"at dusk" or "when the judge leaves"), the bird flies to your location. If you wring its neck and drink its blood, you learn all that it saw since its creation.
