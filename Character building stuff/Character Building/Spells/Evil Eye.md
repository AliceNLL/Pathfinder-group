# Evil Eye
![[icons-commodities-biological-eye-brown.webp|150]]

Your patron's resentment manifests in a baleful, envious gaze. The target becomes [[Sickened 1]] if it fails a Will save (or sickened 2 on a critical failure). This condition value can't be reduced below 1 while the spell is active and you can see the target.
