Your arms and hands swell with new growth, transforming into tree trunks twice as big as their current size. Your fists deal `dice: 1d6` bludgeoning damage, lose the nonlethal trait, and have reach.

**Heightened (3rd)** Your fists gain the magical trait and become a _striking weapon_, increasing the damage your fists deal to `dice: 2d6` bludgeoning.

**Heightened (7th)** Your fists gain the magical trait and become a _greater striking weapon_, increasing the damage your fists deal to `dice: 3d6` bludgeoning. The duration is 10 minutes.

**Heightened (9th)** Your fists gain the magical trait and become a _major striking weapon_, increasing the damage your fists deal to `dice: 4d6` bludgeoning. The duration is 1 hour.
