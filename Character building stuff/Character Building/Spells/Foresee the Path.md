# Foresee the Path
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-forsee-the-path.webp|150]]

You see just a split second into the future and glean how an enemy will move, making it easier for your allies to strike it mid-action. Make a perception {Perception check} against the target enemy's Will DC or Deception DC, whichever is higher. The GM may judge a different DC is more appropriate if it's higher; for instance, using the Warfare Lore DC of a military captain. The target is then temporarily immune for 1 minute.

**Critical Success** The target ally gains a reaction that lets it make a melee [[Strike]] against the target enemy, triggered if the enemy leaves a square within the ally's reach. If the ally already has an ability that lets it make melee Strikes as a reaction, such as Attack of Opportunity, the ally can forgo gaining the temporary reaction to instead gain a +2 status bonus to melee Strikes it makes as reactions.

**Success** As critical success, but the status bonus an ally gets if it forgoes the reaction is +1.

**Failure** The spell has no effect.

* * *

**Amp** The spell has the same result on a failure as on a success (but still no effect on a critical failure). Each time you [[Sustain|Sustain the Spell]], you can choose an additional ally to target, granting them the same benefit as the initial target ally.
