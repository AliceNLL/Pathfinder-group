# Hypnopompic Terrors
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-shadow-raid.webp|150]]

You send a wave of nightmarish visions crashing over your targets, leaving them [[Paralyzed]] by fear. These visions inflict real wounds on vulnerable targets, dealing 6d12 mental damage. If you target a sleeping creature, it wakes up as it attempts the save but takes one degree of success worse than the result it rolled on its save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target is [[Frightened|Frightened 2]] and takes half the mental damage.

**Failure** The target is frightened 2, is [[Paralyzed]] for 1 round, and takes the full mental damage.

**Critical Failure** The target is frightened 2, is paralyzed for 2 rounds, and takes double the mental damage.
