# Frostbite
![[icons-magic-movement-trail-streak-impact-blue.webp|150]]

An orb of biting cold coalesces around your target, freezing its body. The target takes 2d4 cold damage with a basic Fortitude save. On a critical failure, the target also gains weakness 1 to bludgeoning until the start of your next turn.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d4 and the weakness on a critical failure increases by 1.
