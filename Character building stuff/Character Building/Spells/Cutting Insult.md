# Cutting Insult
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-cutting-insult.webp|150]]

You utter an insult so offensive that it cuts your target to the quick. Your target takes 4d6 mental damage and 1 persistent bleed damage and must attempt a Will save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature takes half mental damage but no persistent bleed damage, and it becomes [[Frightened|Frightened 1]].

**Failure** The creature takes full mental damage and full persistent bleed damage, and it becomes [[Frightened|Frightened 2]].

**Critical Failure** The creature takes double mental damage and double persistent bleed damage, and becomes [[Frightened|Frightened 3]].

* * *

**Heightened (+2)** The mental damage increases by 4d6, and the bleed damage increases by 1.
