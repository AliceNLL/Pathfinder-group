# Swallow Light
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-swallow-light.webp|150]]

You draw magical light into your open mouth, consuming it and turning its essence into fuel for a gout of life-draining shadows. Attempt a counteract check against the light effect. If you successfully counteract it, you gain a breath weapon of chilling shadows you can use until the spell ends. Exhaling the breath is a two-action activity. The breath weapon is a 15-foot cone and deals 1d6 cold damage plus 1d6 void damage. Creatures in the area can attempt a basic Reflex save against your spell DC. Once activated, you can't use the breath weapon again for `dice: 1d4` rounds.

* * *

**Heightened (+2)** Increase the damage of the breath weapon by 1d6 cold damage and 1d6 void damage.
