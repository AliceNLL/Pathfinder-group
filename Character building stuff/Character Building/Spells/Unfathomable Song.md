# Unfathomable Song
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-unfathomable-song.webp|150]]

Fleeting notes of a strange and unnatural song fill the air, overtaking the mind. Each target must attempt a Will save when you cast the spell, and again the first time you Sustain this Spell each round. A creature needs to attempt only one save against the song each round, and you have to keep the same targets when you Sustain the Spell.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected, can't be affected on subsequent rounds, and is temporarily immune for 1 minute.

**Success** The target is unaffected this round, but it can be affected on subsequent rounds.
