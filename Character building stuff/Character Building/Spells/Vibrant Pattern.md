# Vibrant Pattern
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-vibrant-pattern.webp|150]]

You create a pattern of lights that pulses with intensity. Creatures are [[Dazzled]] while inside the pattern. In addition, a creature must attempt a Will saving throw if it's inside the pattern when you cast it, enters the pattern, ends its turn within the pattern, or uses a Seek or Interact action on the pattern. A creature currently [[Blinded]] by the pattern doesn't need to attempt new saving throws.

* * *

**Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Failure** The creature is Blinded by the pattern. If it exits the pattern, it can attempt a new save to recover from the Blinded condition at the end of each of its turns, to a maximum duration of 1 minute.

**Critical Failure** The creature is Blinded for 1 minute.
