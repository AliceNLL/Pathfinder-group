# Stormburst
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-stormburst.webp|150]]

Your voice projects like cracking thunder as you summon a localized storm, creating a fearsome surge of lightning and wind that deals 6d6 electricity damage. Each creature must attempt a Reflex saving throw.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature takes half damage.

**Failure** The creature takes full damage and is knocked [[Prone]].

**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage, is knocked prone, and is [[Stunned 1]].

* * *

**Heightened (7th)** The damage increases to 8d6, and targets who critically fail are [[Stunned 1|Stunned 2]].

**Heightened (9th)** The damage increases to 10d6, and targets who critically fail are [[Stunned 1|Stunned 3]].
