![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-summon-healing-servitor.webp|150]]

You call forth a servitor forged from raw vitality energy to heal and bolster your allies. The servitor occupies the space of a Huge creature and has a speed of 60 feet.

**Arrive** (healing, necromancy, vitality) Servitor's Protection The servitor appears in a flash of light, moving from ally to ally and granting them a temporary reprieve. All allies within 20 feet of the Servitor gain 20 temporary Hit Points until the servitor departs.

**Depart** (healing, necromancy, vitality) Servitor's Blessing The servitor disappears in a 30-foot emanation of vitality energy. All willing living creatures within heal 3d8 Hit Points. All undead within take that much damage, with a basic Fortitude save.

* * *

**Heightened (+2)** The Arrive effect's temporary Hit Points increase by 8, and the Depart effect's healing and damage to undead increase by 1d8.
