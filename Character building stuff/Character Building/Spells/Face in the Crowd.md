# Face in the Crowd
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-face-in-the-crowd.webp|150]]

While in a crowd of roughly similar creatures, your appearance becomes bland and nondescript. You gain a +2 status bonus to Deception and Stealth checks to go incognito among the crowd, and you ignore difficult terrain caused by the crowd. This counts as setting up a disguise for the [[Impersonate]] use of Deception and you add your level even if you're untrained.

**Heightened (3rd)** The spell gains a range of 10 feet and can target up to 10 creatures.
