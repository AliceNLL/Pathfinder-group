# Holy Cascade
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-holy-cascade.webp|150]]

You call upon sacred energy to amplify a vial of holy water, tossing it an incredible distance. It explodes in an enormous burst that deals 3d6 bludgeoning damage to creatures in the area from the cascade of water. The water deals an additional 6d6 vitality damage to undead and 6d6 spirit damage to fiends.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The bludgeoning damage increases by 1d6, and the additional vitality and spirit damage each increase by 2d6.
