# Overwhelming Presence
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-overwhelming-presence.webp|150]]

You surround yourself with supernatural splendor, appearing to be a god or similarly majestic being, with an appearance, regalia, and iconography of your choice. Targets must attempt a Will save. Regardless of the outcome, the target is then temporarily immune for 1 minute.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target must pay tribute to you two times. Paying tribute requires that the target spend a single action, which has either the move trait (as they bow) or manipulate trait (as they offer up a token in their hands). They must pay tribute at least once on each of their turns, if possible. While affected, the target is [[Fascinated]] by you and can't use hostile actions against you.

**Failure** As success, but the target must pay tribute a total of six times.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target must spend all its actions paying tribute, and they cannot take other actions until the tribute is fully paid.
