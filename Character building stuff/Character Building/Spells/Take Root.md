# Take Root
![[icons-magic-nature-tree-elm-roots-brown.webp|150]]

Roots sprout from the flesh of the target and coil across the floor or around objects, reinforcing their stance or grip. The targeted creature gains a +1 circumstance bonus to their Fortitude DC against attempts to [[Shove]] them and a +1 circumstance bonus to their Reflex DC against attempts to [[Disarm]] or [[Trip]] them. This bonus also applies to saving throws against spells or effects that would attempt to remove a held item from their grasp.
