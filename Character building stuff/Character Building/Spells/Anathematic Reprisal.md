# Anathematic Reprisal
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-anathematic-reprisal.webp|150]]

**Trigger** A creature performs an act anathema to your deity.

* * *

You punish a creature that transgresses against your deity, drawing upon the anguish you feel upon seeing one of your deity's anathema committed. You can cast this spell only when a creature actively commits a unique act of anathema. For example, if creating undead were anathema to your deity, you could use anathematic reprisal on a necromancer who had just created undead in front of you, but not on an undead creature just for existing. You deal 4d6 mental damage to the target, but a basic Will save can reduce this damage. If it fails, it is also [[Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] for 1 round. The creature is then temporarily immune for 1 minute.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d6.
