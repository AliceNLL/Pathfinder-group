# Symphony of the Unfettered Heart
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-symphony-of-the-unfettered-heart.webp|150]]

Your symphony lifts listeners from their worldly concerns. Attempt a Performance check to counteract an effect applying one of the following conditions to the target: [[Grabbed]], [[Immobilized]], [[Paralyzed]], [[Restrained]], [[Slowed|Slowed]], or [[Stunned 1|Stunned]]. If you fail, you can't target the same effect on the target for 1 day. Use the condition's source to determine the counteract DC (for example, the [[Escape]] DC for grabbed).

* * *

**Heightened (9th)** You can target up to four creatures.
