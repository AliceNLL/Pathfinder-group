# Warp Mind
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-warp-mind.webp|150]]

You scramble a creature's mental faculties and sensory input. The target must attempt a Will saving throw. Regardless of the result of that save, the target is then temporarily immune for 10 minutes. Warp mind's effects happen instantly, so [[Dispel Magic]] and other effects that counteract spells can't counteract them. However, [[Wish]] rituals and abilities that can remove non-magical effects can still counteract the effects.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target spends the first action on its next turn with the [[Confused]] condition.

**Failure** The target is Confused for 1 minute.

**Critical Failure** The target is Confused permanently.
