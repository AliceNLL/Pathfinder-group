# Sea of Thought
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-sea-of-thought.webp|150]]

You cover the area in a sloshing torrent of semi-solidified thought, roughly ankle high. The area becomes difficult terrain, similarly to a shallow bog. Each round that a creature starts its turn in the area, it must attempt a Fortitude save against the shifting waves of thought. On a failure, it takes a -10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds until it leaves the area, and on a critical failure, it is also knocked [[Prone]].

**Heightened (+1)** The radius of the spell's area increases by 5 feet.
