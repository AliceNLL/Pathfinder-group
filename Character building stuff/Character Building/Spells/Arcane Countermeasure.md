# Arcane Countermeasure
![[icons-magic-light-projectiles-star-purple.webp|150]]

**Trigger** A creature within range that you can see Casts a Spell.

* * *

You undermine the target spell, making it easier to defend against. You reduce the spell's level by 1, and targets of the spell gain a +2 status bonus to any saving throws, skill checks, AC, or DC against it. You can't reduce the spell's level below its minimum.

For example, a 5th-level cone of cold would remain 5th-level, but a 5th-level fireball would become 4th-level. Targets still gain all the other benefits, even if you don't reduce the spell's level.
