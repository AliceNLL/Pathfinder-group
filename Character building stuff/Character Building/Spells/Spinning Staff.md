# Spinning Staff
![[icons-magic-lightning-bolt-strike-explosion-purple.webp|150]]

You spin your staff with a twirling flourish, attacking two foes and transforming the momentum into magical energy to charge for your next [[Spellstrike]]. Make a melee Strike with your staff against one foe and then a second melee Strike with your staff against a different foe. Your multiple attack penalty applies to both of these attacks as normal.

_Note: Conflux spells refresh Spellstrike._
