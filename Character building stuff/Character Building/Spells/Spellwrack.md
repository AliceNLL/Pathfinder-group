# Spellwrack
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-spellwrack.webp|150]]

You cause any spells cast on the target to spill out their energy in harmful surges. The target must attempt a Will save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** Whenever the target becomes affected by a spell with a duration, the target takes 2d12 persistent,force damage. Each time it takes persistent force damage from _spellwrack_, it reduces the remaining duration of spells affecting it by 1 round. Only a successful arcana  check against your spell DC can help the target recover from the persistent damage; the curse and the persistent damage end after 1 minute.

**Failure** As success, but the curse and persistent damage do not end on their own.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but the persistent force damage is 4d12 persistent,force.
