You force the target to see a vision of its own death. It takes 8d6 mental damage with a Will save. If the target is reduced to 0 HP by this spell, its vision becomes reality and kills it instantly.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target takes half damage and is [[Frightened|Frightened 1]].

**Failure** The target takes full damage and is [[Frightened|Frightened 2]].

**Critical Failure** The target takes double damage, is [[Frightened|Frightened 4]] and is [[Fleeing]] for as long as it's frightened.

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 2d6.
