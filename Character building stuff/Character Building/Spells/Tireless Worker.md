# Tireless Worker
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-tireless-worker.webp|150]]

You suppress your choice of one of the following conditions that's affecting the target: [[Clumsy 1|Clumsy]], [[Encumbered]], [[Enfeebled 1|Enfeebled]], or [[Fatigued]]. If you don't remove the effect that caused the condition, the condition returns after the spell's duration expires.
