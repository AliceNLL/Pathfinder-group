You utter phrases in an unknown tongue, assaulting the minds of those nearby. Each target must attempt a Will save. Regardless of the result of its save, each target is then temporarily immune for 1 minute.

You can increase the number of actions it takes to Cast the Spell (to a maximum of 3 actions total). For each additional action, increase the emanation's radius by 5 feet, to a maximum of 10 extra feet for 3 actions.

**Success** The target is unaffected.

**Failure** The target is [[Stupefied|Stupefied 2]].

**Critical Failure** The target is [[Confused]].

**Heightened (+3)** The initial radius increases by 5 feet.
