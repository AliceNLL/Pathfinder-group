# Diamond Dust
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-diamond-dust.webp|150]]

You supercool the nearby air, forming a cloud of dancing ice crystals in an emanation around you. A creature other than you that enters the area or ends its turn within the area takes 2d6 cold damage. A creature can take this damage only once per turn. The crystals scatter and refract light; if a light effect enters diamond dust's area, any creatures that effect goes on to affect gain a +2 status bonus to AC and saves against it. While the spell persists, you can activate or deactivate this aura by using a single action, which has the concentrate trait. You can Dismiss this spell.

**Heightened (+2)** The damage increases by 1d6.
