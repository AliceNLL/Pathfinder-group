# Protect Companion
![[icons-equipment-shield-kite-wooden-oak-glow.webp|150]]

You extend your aura, as a magical shield that protects your eidolon or minion. The target gains a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of your next turn. You gain the [[Life Block]] reaction; after using the reaction, the spell ends and you can't cast protect companion again for 10 minutes.

* * *

**Heightened (+2)** The reaction reduces the damage by another 10, and you lose 5 more Hit Points. If you want to lose fewer Hit Points, you can choose to lower the damage reduction and HP lost to what any lower-level version of the spell could do without lowering the spell's actual level.
