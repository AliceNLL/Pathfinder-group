![[icons-magic-fire-projectile-feathers-embers-gold.webp|150]]

**Trigger** A foe reduces you to half your Hit Points or fewer.

* * *

You feel the most alive when pushed into a corner, as the insights and vision granted by the flame stoke into overdrive. Your body begins to emit a blazing aura of flames. You gain greater darkvision, low‚Äêlight vision, and the ability to see invisible creatures. You gain a fly Speed equal to your land Speed as you launch flame from your aura to soar through the sky. You become [[Quickened]], and you can use the extra action each round only to Strike or [[Fly]] using your flames. Any creature who starts their turn within 5 feet of you takes 1d12 fire damage.
