# Rebounding Barrier
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-rebounding-barrier.webp|150]]

**Trigger** You are hit by a physical Strike.

* * *

You swiftly raise a reflective barrier, reducing physical damage and rebounding it onto your attacker. You gain resistance 10 against one physical damage type the triggering attack deals. Your attacker takes 5 damage of the same type.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The resistance increases by 2. Damage dealt to your attacker increases by 1.
