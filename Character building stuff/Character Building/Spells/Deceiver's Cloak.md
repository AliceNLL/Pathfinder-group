# Deceiver's Cloak
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-deceivers-cloak.webp|150]]

Your patron drapes a cloak of illusion about you, making you appear as another creature of the same body shape with roughly similar height and weight as yourself. This has the effects of a 3rd-rank_[[Illusory Disguise]]_.

* * *

**Heightened (6th)** You can appear as any creature of the same size, even with a completely different body shape.
