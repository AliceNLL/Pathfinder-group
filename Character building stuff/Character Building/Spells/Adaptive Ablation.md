# Adaptive Ablation
![[icons-magic-unholy-energy-smoke-pink.webp|150]]

**Trigger** You take acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage.

* * *

You shift yourself to adapt to the mystical wavelengths of the energy damage, protecting yourself from further harm. You gain resistance 5 to the triggering energy type; you gain this resistance after you take the triggering damage, so it applies only to future damage you take during the duration.

* * *

**Heightened (+2)** Increase the resistance by 5.
