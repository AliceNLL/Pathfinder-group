# Hypnotize
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-hypnotic-pattern.webp|150]]

You create a cloud of mesmerizing patterns and colors that hovers in the air. Creatures are [[Dazzled]] while inside the cloud. In addition, a creature must attempt a Will saving throw if it is inside the cloud when you cast it, when it enters the cloud, when it ends its turn within the cloud, or if it uses a [[Seek]] or Interact action on the cloud. A creature currently [[Fascinated]] by hypnotize doesn't attempt new saves.

**Success** The target is unaffected.

**Failure** The target is fascinated by the cloud.

**Critical Failure** The target is fascinated by the cloud. While it remains fascinated, it can't use reactions.
