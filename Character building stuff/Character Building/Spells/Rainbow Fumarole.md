**Area** 20-foot radius, 60-foot-tall cylinder

Multi-hued flames break through cracks in the ground, reaching high into the sky and giving off dangerous fumes. When you cast the spell, roll 1d8 on the table below to determine the effects of the fumarole.

Any creature caught inside the area of _rainbow fumarole_ when you cast it takes the indicated damage with a basic Reflex save and, on a failure, takes any added effect listed. Creatures must also attempt a saving throw when they move through the spell's area or end their turn in it. Squares within the area of the _rainbow fumarole_ are difficult terrain.
