# Ignite Ambition
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-blind-ambition.webp|150]]

**Trigger** You or an ally in range attempt to use a mental effect to convince a creature to do something (such as a [[Coerce]], [[Request]], or a [[Suggestion]] spell).

* * *

You strengthen a target's ambition, increase its resentment of allies, and make its allegiances more susceptible to change. The target must attempt a Will save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected and realized you attempted to influence its reaction with magic.

**Success** The target takes a -1 status penalty to its defenses against the triggering effect. This penalty is -2 if the target is being encouraged to advance its own ambitions.The target doesn't realize you Cast the Spell on it.

**Failure** As success, but the penalty is -4 if the target is being encouraged to advance its own ambitions.

**Critical Failure** As success, but the creature automatically follows a suggestion that advances its own ambitions.
