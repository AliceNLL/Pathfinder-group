# Vampiric Maiden
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-vampiric-maiden.webp|150]]

A ghostly iron maiden snaps shut on the target and drains its vitality for your gain. This deals 4d4 piercing damage and 4d4 void damage, and the target must attempt a Fortitude save. You gain temporary HP equal to the void damage the target takes (after applying resistances, weaknesses, and the like). You lose any remaining temporary HP after 1 minute.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target takes half damage.

**Failure** The target is briefly trapped within the vampiric maiden. The target takes full damage and is [[Immobilized]] by the iron maiden for 1 round or until it uses an [[Interact]] action to extricate itself, whichever comes first.

**Critical Failure** The target takes double damage and is Immobilized by the vampiric maiden for 1 round or until it [[Escape|Escapes]](the DC is your spell DC), whichever comes first.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The piercing and void damage increase by 1d4 each.
