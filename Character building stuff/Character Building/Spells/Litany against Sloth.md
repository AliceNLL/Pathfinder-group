# Litany against Sloth
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-litany-against-sloth.webp|150]]

Your litany rails against the sin of sloth, interfering with the target's ability to react. The target must attempt a Will save. A particularly slothful creature, such as a sloth demon, uses the outcome one degree of success worse than the result of its saving throw. The target becomes temporarily immune to all of your litanies for 1 minute.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target can't use reactions.

**Failure** The target can't use reactions and is [[Slowed]].

**Critical Failure** The target can't use reactions and is [[Slowed|Slowed 2]].
