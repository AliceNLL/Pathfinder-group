# Desperate Repair
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-desperate-repair.webp|150]]

**Trigger** A shield within range would be reduced to 0 Hit Points by a damaging effect

**Requirements** The triggering shield had more than 1 Hit Point before taking damage.

* * *

You hold a shield together with the power of your magic, forcing wood and steel to fuse back together. The shield remains at 1 Hit Point and isn't destroyed. Its construction is weakened until someone takes the time to repair it, preventing _desperate repair_ or a similar ability from saving the same shield until your next daily preparations.
