# Fortissimo Composition
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-inspire-heroics.webp|150]]

You call upon your muse to greatly increase the benefits you provide with your _courageous anthem_, _rallying anthem_, or _song of strength_ composition. If your next action is to cast one of these compositions, attempt a Performance check. The DC is usually the highest Will DC of the composition's targets, but the GM can assign a different DC based on the circumstances. The effect of your composition depends on the result of your check.

* * *

**Critical Success** The status bonus from your composition increases to +3.

**Success** The status bonus from your composition increases to +2.

**Failure** Your composition provides only its normal bonus of +1, but you don't spend the Focus Point for casting this spell.
