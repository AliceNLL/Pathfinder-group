# Fire Ray
![[icons-magic-fire-blast-jet-stream-embers-red.webp|150]]

A blazing band of fire arcs through the air, lighting your opponent and the ground they stand upon on fire. Make a spell attack roll against the target's AC. The ray deals 2d6 fire damage on a hit (or double damage on a critical hit). On any result other than a critical failure, the ground in the target's space catches fire, dealing 1d6 fire damage to each creature that ends its turn in one of the squares.

**Heightened (+1)** The ray's initial damage increases by 2d6, and the fire damage dealt by the burning space increases by 1d6.
