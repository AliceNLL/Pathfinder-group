# Unbreaking Wave Barrier
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-tidal-surge.webp|150]]

You create a protective circle around yourself that repels your foes. You gain a +1 status bonus to AC. Any creature other than you within the area, or attempting to move into the area, must attempt a Fortitude saving throw; a creature needs to attempt the Fortitude saving throw only once each round. If a creature pushed by _unbreaking wave barrier_ would be pushed into a solid barrier or another creature, it stops at that point and takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage for every additional 5 feet it would've been pushed. On subsequent rounds, the first time you [[Sustain]] this Spell each round, you can increase the radius of the barrier by 5 feet.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature isn't pushed, but the space within the barrier is difficult terrain for it.

**Failure** The creature is pushed 10 feet, and the space within the barrier is difficult terrain for it.

**Critical Failure** The creature is pushed 20 feet and knocked [[Prone]], and the space within the barrier is difficult terrain for it.
