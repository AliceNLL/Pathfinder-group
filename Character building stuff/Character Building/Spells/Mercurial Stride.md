# Mercurial Stride
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-mercurial-stride.webp|150]]

Your form ripples as you take on the fluidity and toxicity of quicksilver. You partially shift into a liquid metal form and Stride up to twice your speed. During this movement, you can pass through one creature's space—without needing to attempt a check to [[Tumble Through]]—by splitting into droplets of mercury and reforming on the other side, though you can't end your turn in such a space. Passing through a creature's space in this way exposes it to mercury poisoning, with a Fortitude save.
