# Heinous Future
![[icons-magic-perception-orb-eye-scrying.webp|150]]

You hold up a fractured mirror to the target, and in that mirror it sees a thing that may yet come to passâ€”a ghastly foretelling that the target instinctively knows is eerily possible. It's not a guaranteed thing, just a dreadful possibility, but it haunts the target's thoughts all the same.

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target is [[Slowed]] and [[Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] for 1 round.

**Failure** The target is slowed 1 and stupefied 1 until it next gets eight hours of rest.

**Critical Failure** The target is [[Slowed|Slowed 2]] and [[Stupefied|Stupefied 2]], decreasing these conditions by 1 for each eight hours of rest it gets.
