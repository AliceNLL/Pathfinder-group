You cause the creature's vision to become particularly sensitive. The creature must attempt a Fortitude save. The creature is then temporarily immune for 1 minute.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature is [[Dazzled]] for 1 round.

**Failure** The creature is dazzled for 1 minute.

**Critical Failure** The creature gains [[Light Blindness]] for 1 minute. If the creature is already exposed to bright light, it immediately becomes [[Blinded]], as it isn't acclimated to its newly acquired light blindness.

* * *

**Heightened (6th)** You can target up to 10 creatures.
