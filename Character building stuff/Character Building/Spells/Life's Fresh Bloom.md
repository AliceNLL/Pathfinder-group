# Life's Fresh Bloom
![[icons-magic-nature-leaf-drip-light-green.webp|150]]

The ground around you blooms with life, sprouting sparkling grass, flowers, and small shrubs. Each living and non-nindoru creature that starts its turn standing on the ground in the area recovers 1d6 Hit Points and gains a +5-foot status bonus to its Speed until the end of its next turn. Nindoru fiends and undead that start their turn in the area of life's fresh bloom instead become [[Sickened 1]] unless they succeed at a Fortitude saving throw.

* * *

**Heightened (7th)** Increase the Hit Points restored to 1d8 and [[Sickened 1|Sickened 2]].

**Heightened (10th)** Increase the Hit Points restored to 1d10 and [[Sickened 1|Sickened 3]].
