# Web of Influence
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-web-of-influence.webp|150]]

You learn the location of the nearest creature to whom the target is connected in a magical manner. A creature sustaining a spell on the target is connected to it for the purposes of this spell, as are any creatures who are targets of a spell effect currently affecting the target (such as all the targets of a _[[Illusory Disguise]]_ spell), members of a coven, and creatures that are magically bonded to the target (such as with the _[[Heartbond]]_ ritual). The GM is the final arbiter of whether a creature is magically connected to the target. If you already know individuals who are magically connected to the target, you can exclude them from the spell.

This spell doesn't tell you anything about the nearest magically connected creature other than its current distance and direction. If the nearest creature is on a different plane the spell indicates this but doesn't reveal which plane.
