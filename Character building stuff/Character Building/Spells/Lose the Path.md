# Lose the Path
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-lose-the-path.webp|150]]

**Trigger** A creature in range Strides

* * *

You surround a moving creature with lifelike illusions, shifting their perception of the terrain to subtly lead them off course. The target must attempt a Will save. Regardless of the result, the creature is immune to lose the path for 1 hour.

* * *

**Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Failure** The creature treats all squares as difficult terrain for its Stride.

**Critical Failure** As failure, except that you determine where the target moves during the Stride, though you can't move it into hazardous terrain or to a place it can't stand.
