# Shadow Zombie
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-shadow-zombie.webp|150]]

You cast a shadow over the target zombie, briefly turning it into shadowy vapor and controlling its movement. While in this vaporous state, the zombie is a minion under your control, gains resistance 8 to physical damage, and is immune to precision damage. It can't cast spells, activate items, or use actions that have the attack or manipulate traits. It gains a fly Speed of 10 feet and can slip through tiny cracks. If the target is already your minion when you cast the spell, it doesn't get a saving throw and becomes vaporous for 10 minutes. If the target is not your minion, it can attempt a Will save to resist the spell. If it's already under someone else's command, the controlling creature also rolls a Will save, and the zombie uses the better result.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected and is temporarily immune for 24 hours.

**Success** The target is unaffected.

**Failure** The target becomes your shadowy minion for 1 minute.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but for 10 minutes.

**Heightened (4th)** You can target a zombie of level 5 or lower.
