# Vibrant Thorns
![[icons-magic-nature-thorns-hand-glow-green.webp|150]]

Your body sprouts a coat of brambly thorns that thrive on life magic. Adjacent creatures that hit you with a melee attack, as well as creatures that hit you with unarmed attacks, take 1 piercing damage each time they do. Anytime you cast a vitality spell, the thorns' damage increases to 1d6 until the start of your next turn.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1, or 1d6 after you cast a vitality spell.
