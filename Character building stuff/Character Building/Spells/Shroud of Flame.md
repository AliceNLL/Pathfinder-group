# Shroud of Flame
![[icons-magic-fire-projectile-feathers-embers-gold.webp|150]]

You encircle yourself in an aura of protective flames. Each creature that hits you with an unarmed attack, Grapples you, or otherwise touches you takes 3 fire damage. When you Cast the Spell and the first time you sustain it each round, each creature in the area takes 3d6 fire damage (basic Reflex save).

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The damage caused by touching you increases by 1, and the fire damage when you Cast the Spell or sustain it increases by 1d6.
