# Moonlight Ray
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-moonlight-ray.webp|150]]

You unleash a holy beam of freezing moonlight. Make a ranged spell attack. The ray deals 5d6 cold damage; if the target is a fiend or undead, you deal an extra 5d6 spirit damage.

_Moonlight ray_'s cold damage is silver damage for the purposes of weaknesses, resistances, and the like.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target takes double cold damage, as well as double spirit damage if a fiend or undead.

**Success** The target takes full damage.

If the light passes through an area of magical darkness or targets a creature affected by magical darkness, _moonlight ray_ attempts to counteract the darkness. If you need to determine whether the light passes through an area of darkness, draw a line between yourself and the spell's target.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The cold damage increases by 2d6, and the spirit damage against fiends and undead increases by 2d6.
