# Spout
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-spout.webp|150]]

**Area** 5-foot cube or 5-foot burst

* * *

Water blasts upward, coming out of the ground, rising from a pool, or even manifesting from thin air. Any creatures in the area take 2d4 bludgeoning damage, with a basic Reflex saving throw.

You can change this spell's area to a 5-foot burst, provided you center the burst in a body of water. This body of water can be as small as a pond or creek, but not as small as a puddle or bathtub.

A creature that critically fails its save is disoriented by the explosion of water, becoming [[Off-Guard]] until the end of your next turn.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d4.
