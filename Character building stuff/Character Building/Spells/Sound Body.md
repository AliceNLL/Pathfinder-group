![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-wholeness-of-body.webp|150]]

You send a surge of healing energy to restore the target's body. Attempt to counteract an effect of your choice imposing one of these conditions on the target: [[Blinded]], [[Dazzled]], [[Deafened]], [[Enfeebled 1|Enfeebled]], or [[Sickened 1|Sickened]].

The effect's duration doesn't elapse while it's suppressed.

This spell can't counteract or suppress curses, diseases, or conditions that are part of the target's normal state.
