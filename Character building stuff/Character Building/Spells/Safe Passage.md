# Safe Passage
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-safe-passage.webp|150]]

You make passage through the area safe for a brief amount of time. Anyone passing through the area gains the following benefits against harmful effects of the terrain and environment, including environmental damage, hazardous terrain, and hazards in the area. The spell grants a +2 status bonus to AC and saves against such effects, and resistance 5 to all damage from such effects. Furthermore, the spell prevents anything in the area that's prone to collapse, such as a rickety bridge or an unstable ceiling, from collapsing, except under extreme strain that would collapse a normal structure of its type.

_Safe passage_ protects only against harm, not inconvenience, and it doesn't reduce difficult terrain, remove the [[Concealed]] condition caused by precipitation, or the like, nor does it protect against creatures within the spell's area.
