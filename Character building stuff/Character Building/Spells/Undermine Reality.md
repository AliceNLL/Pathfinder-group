# Undermine Reality
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-undermine-reality.webp|150]]

You lash a target with tendrils of shadow that steal some of its substance, making it quasi-real. As long as it is quasi-real, its Strikes deal half damage, it can't critically succeed at any skill check, and creatures attempting saving throws against its spells and effects get a result one degree of success better than they rolled. The target must attempt a Will saving throw.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target is quasi-real until the end of its next turn.

**Failure** The target is quasi-real for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, it can attempt another Will save, ending the spell on a success.

**Critical Failure** The target is quasi-real for an unlimited duration.
