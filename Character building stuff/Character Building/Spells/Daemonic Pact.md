# Daemonic Pact
![[icons-creatures-unholy-demon-fire-horned-winged-roar.webp|150]]

You call upon the powers of Abaddon to grant you the assistance of a daemon. You call upon a daemon whose level can be no more than double _daemonic pact's_ spell level, two daemons whose levels are each at least 2 less than double the spell level, or three daemons whose levels are each at least 3 less than double the spell level.

* * *

**Critical Success** You conjure the daemon or daemons, and they require nothing in return for their service.

**Success** You conjure the daemon or daemons, who serve you willingly, but require a sacrifice in the form of spilled blood (either another creature's or your own).

**Failure** You don't conjure any daemons.

**Critical Failure** You don't conjure any daemons, and the self-sacrifice required to perform the ritual leaves you [[Drained 1]] (or [[Drained 1|Drained 2]] if the spell level is 5 or higher).
