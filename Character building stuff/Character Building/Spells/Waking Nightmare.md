# Waking Nightmare
![[icons-creatures-invertebrates-spider-striped-web-red.webp|150]]

You fill the creature's mind with a terrifying vision. The target must attempt a Will save. A creature frightened by this spell takes 1 additional mental damage each time it's hit by a Strike.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target is [[Frightened|Frightened 1]].

**Failure** The target is [[Frightened|Frightened 2]]. If it's asleep, it wakes up and is [[Paralyzed]] for 1 round.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but [[Frightened|Frightened 3]].

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The mental damage increases by 1.
