# Magic Warrior Transformation
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-magic-warrior.webp|150]]

You transform into the animal from your mask. You gain the effects of _[[Animal Form]]_, heightened to magic warrior transformation's level, and you can transform into only the type of animal your mask represents.
