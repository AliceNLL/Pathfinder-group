# Shatter Mind
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-shatter-mind.webp|150]]

15 foot cone

* * *

You telepathically assail the minds of your foes. You deal 3d4 mental damage to all enemies in the area, with a basic Will save.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d4.

* * *

**Amp** You increase the area of the spell to your choice of a 30 foot cone or 60 foot cone, and the damage dice for the spell change to d10s. Creatures that fail are [[Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] until the start of your next turn (or [[Stupefied|Stupefied 2]] on a critical failure).
