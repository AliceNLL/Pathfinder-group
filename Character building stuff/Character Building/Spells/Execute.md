You point at a creature and invoke the demise of all things. The target takes 70 void damage with a basic Fortitude save. If the target is undead or otherwise has void healing, the spell loses the death and void traits and gains the vitality trait, and the target takes 70 vitality damage with a basic Fortitude save.
