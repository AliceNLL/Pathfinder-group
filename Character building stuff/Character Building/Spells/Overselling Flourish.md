**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature is thrown off by your display. The creature becomes [[Dazzled]] until the start of your turn.

**Failure** The creature fully believes your performance, leaving itself open. The creature becomes dazzled and [[Off-Guard]] until the start of your turn.

**Critical Failure** The creature is enraptured by the display. The creature uses its remaining actions to watch you in awe. It then remains dazzled and off-guard until the start of your turn.
