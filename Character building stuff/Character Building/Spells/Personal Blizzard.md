# Personal Blizzard
![[icons-magic-water-snowflake-ice-blue-white.webp|150]]

Your patron's breath becomes blizzard of obscuring, scouring ice that follows your target. The target attempts a Fortitude save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target takes 1d6 cold damage, and the spell ends.

**Failure** The target takes 1d6 cold damage and 1d6 persistent,cold damage. The persistent damage automatically ends when the spell ends. It is [[Concealed]] to other creatures, and other creatures are concealed to it.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but both the cold damage and the persistent cold damage increase to 2d6.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The cold damage and persistent cold damage increase by 1 (2 on a critical failure).
