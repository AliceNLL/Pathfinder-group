# Dragon Wings
![[icons-creatures-abilities-wing-batlike-red-pink.webp|150]]

Leathery wings sprout from your back, giving you a fly Speed of 60 feet or your Speed, whichever is faster. When this spell's duration would end, if you're still flying, you float to the ground, as _[[Gentle Landing]]_.

You can increase the Focus Point cost by 1 to gain the effects of _[[Dragon Claws]]_ as long as the wings last.

**Heightened (8th)** The duration increases to 10 minutes.
