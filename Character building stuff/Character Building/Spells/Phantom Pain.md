# Phantom Pain
![[icons-magic-unholy-strike-beam-blood-small-red-purple.webp|150]]

Illusory pain wracks the target, dealing 2d4 mental damage and 1d4 persistent mental damage. The target must attempt a Will save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target takes full initial damage but no persistent damage, and the spell ends immediately.

**Failure** The target takes full initial and persistent damage, and the target is [[Sickened 1]]. If the target recovers from being Sickened, the persistent damage ends and the spell ends.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target is [[Sickened 1|Sickened 2]].

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 2d4 and the persistent damage by 1d4.
