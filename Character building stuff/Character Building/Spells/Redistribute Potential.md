# Redistribute Potential
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-redistribute-potential.webp|150]]

**Area** two adjacent 5-foot squares

* * *

Energy attempts to balance out, but with your magic, you can shunt all the energy in one area to another. Creatures in either area take basic Fortitude save. Choose one of the squares to steal heat, dealing cold damage, and the other to concentrate the stolen heat, dealing fire damage. A creature that fails its save also becomes [[Clumsy 1]] from numbness if it's in the area of stolen heat or [[Enfeebled 1]] from heat stroke if it's in the area of concentrated heat; these conditions last until the start of your next turn. If a creature is large enough to be in both squares, you choose only one of the areas for it to attempt its save against; it's unaffected by the other area.

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d4.

**Amp** You can affect the flow of energy on a much grander scale. Instead of two 5-foot squares, you create two 10 foot burst{10 foot bursts}. They still must be adjacent to one another and can overlap. A creature in both areas can still be affected by only one of your choice. The spell's damage increases to 6d6. The conditions last for 1 minute.

**Amp Heightened (+1)** Increase the damage by 2d6 instead of 1d4.
