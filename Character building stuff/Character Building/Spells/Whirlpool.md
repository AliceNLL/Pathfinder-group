# Whirlpool
![[icons-magic-water-vortex-water-whirlpool.webp|150]]

**Area** 25-foot radius, 20-foot tall cylinder

* * *

With a spin of your hand, you create a large swirling vortex of storming waves. All squares in the _whirlpool_ are difficult terrain. The constant churning of the fierce waves means that creatures are constantly tossed between areas of air and water, allowing both air- and water-breathing creatures to breathe within the vortex. Any creature with a swim Speed can Swim instead of Stride to move within the whirlpool; the DC to Swim within it is equal to your spell DC.

All creatures in the area take 6d10 bludgeoning damage as the waves crash into them. On subsequent rounds, the first time you Sustain the spell each round, the waves crash again with the same effect.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature takes half damage.

**Failure** The creature takes full damage and is drawn 10 feet toward the center of the whirlpool.

**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage and is drawn to the center of the whirlpool.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The bludgeoning damage increases by 1d10.
