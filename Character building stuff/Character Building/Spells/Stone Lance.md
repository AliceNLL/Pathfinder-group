# Stone Lance
![[icons-skills-wounds-bone-broken-knee-beam.webp|150]]

You conjure a jagged lance of stone and then launch it at a foe. Make a spell attack roll against the target. On a hit, you deal 6d6 piercing damage and the lance impales the creature, giving it a -10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds unless it Escapes. On a critical hit, if the creature is on the ground, the lance also embeds into the ground and [[Immobilized|Immobilizes]] the creature until it Escapes. A creature that Escapes after being impaled takes 3 bleed damage. When the spell ends, the lance crumbles into dirt, freeing the target if it hasn't Escaped.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** Increase the damage by 2d6 and the persistent bleed damage for Escapes by 1.
