# Wooden Double
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-wooden-double.webp|150]]

**Trigger** You're critically hit by a damage-dealing effect or a Strike.

* * *

A wooden double appears out of nowhere and takes the blow in your place. Take a Step action. A wooden block of your size and roughly shaped like you appears in the space you left and absorbs the hit. This block has Hardness 5 and 20 Hit Points. If the wooden block is destroyed, you take any excess damage that the block didn't absorb. After taking the blow, the wooden block collapses into a pile of splinters and dust.

* * *

**Heightened (+1)** The block's Hit Points increase by 10.
