![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-updraft.webp|150]]

A powerful blast of wind erupts from the ground, launching the target into the air and sending it crashing back down. The collision deals 2d6 bludgeoning damage with a basic Reflex save. On a failure, the target is knocked [[Prone]].

**Heightened (+1)** Increase the damage by 2d6.
