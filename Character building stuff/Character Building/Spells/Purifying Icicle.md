# Purifying Icicle
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-purifying-icicle.webp|150]]

You evoke life essence into the form of water and freeze it, then launch the icicle at a foe. Make a spell attack roll. On a success, the icicle deals 2d6 piercing damage and 1d6 cold damage, and if the target is undead, the icicle deals an additional 1d4 vitality damage. On a critical success, the target takes double damage and takes a -10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds for 1 round as the icicle lodges inside them before melting away.

**Heightened (+1)** The piercing damage and cold damage each increase by 1d6. The vitality damage increases by 1d4.
