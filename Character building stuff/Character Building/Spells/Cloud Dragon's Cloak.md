# Cloud Dragon's Cloak
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-cloud-dragons-cloak.webp|150]]

**Trigger** You or an ally in range is targeted by a ranged attack.

* * *

A cloud of mist enshrouds the target, appearing much like the deflecting clouds created by cloud dragons. The target is treated as [[Hidden]] for the purposes of resolving the triggering attack (so normally the attacker must succeed at a DC 11 flat to target it) and all ranged attacks against it for the duration.
