# Necrotize
![[icons-magic-unholy-hand-fire-skeleton-pink.webp|150]]

You necrotize part of a creature's body, harming it and debilitating it as its body putrefies, mimicking the natural process of decay. The target takes 12d6 void damage and one of the following debilitations; roll 1d4 to randomly determine which. The effects depend on its Fortitude save.

1.  **Bones** The target's bones necrotize and become spongy and weak, giving it weakness 3 to bludgeoning damage.
2.  **Joints** The target's joints necrotize, making its movements ungainly and clumsy. It becomes [[Clumsy 1]].
3.  **Legs** The target's legs necrotize, as well as any other limbs associated with forms of movement, making it harder for the creature to move. The target takes a -10-foot status penalty to its Speeds. 
4.  **Muscles** The target's muscles necrotize, rotting away. The target becomes [[Enfeebled 1]].

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target takes half damage and the debilitation lasts until the end of your next turn.

**Failure** The target takes full damage and the debilitation lasts for 1 minute.

**Critical Failure** The target takes double damage, and you can pick a second debilitation to apply, in addition to the one you rolled randomly. Both debilitations last for 1 minute.

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 2d6.
