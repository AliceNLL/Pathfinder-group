**Trigger** You're targeted by an attack made by an attacker you can see.

You're [[Concealed]] against the triggering attack and gain a +2 circumstance bonus to AC against it. After the triggering attack is complete, you can Step if the triggering attack hit or Step twice if the triggering attack missed.
