![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-song-of-strength.webp|150]]

You bolster your allies' physical strength with a hearty exhortation. You and your allies gain a +1 status bonus to Athletics checks and to their DCs against Athletics skill actions such as [[Disarm]], [[Reposition]], [[Shove]], and [[Trip]].
