# Spellkeeper Shisk
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-heritage.svg|150]]

Your magical knowledge allows you to cast simple spells. Choose occult or primal. You gain one cantrip from that magical tradition's spell list. You can cast this spell as an innate spell at will, as a spell of your chosen tradition. A cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up.
