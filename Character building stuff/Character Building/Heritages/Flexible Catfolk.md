# Flexible Catfolk
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-heritage.svg|150]]

You've inherited flexibility beyond that of most humanoids. You don't treat tight spaces that don't require you to Squeeze as difficult terrain. In addition, you get a +1 circumstance bonus to checks when you attempt to Escape.
