# Frozen Wind Kitsune
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-heritage.svg|150]]

Your ancestors crossed the Crown of the World or resided on snowy peaks. You gain cold resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1). You treat environmental cold effects as if they were one step less extreme (incredible cold becomes extreme, extreme cold becomes severe, and so on). Your alternate form is a common Medium humanoid ancestry prevalent where you grew up (typically human), called a tailless form.
