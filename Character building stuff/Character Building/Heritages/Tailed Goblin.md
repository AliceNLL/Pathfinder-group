# Tailed Goblin
![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-ancestry-tailed-goblin.webp|150]]

You have a powerful tail, likely because you descend from a community of monkey goblins. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Athletics checks to [[Climb]], you gain [[Combat Climber]] as a bonus feat, and you reduce the number of free hands required to climb or [[Trip]] by one.
