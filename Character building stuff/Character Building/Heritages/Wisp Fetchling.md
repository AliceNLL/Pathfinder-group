# Wisp Fetchling
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-heritage.svg|150]]

Your ancestors' exposure to the Shadow Plane wrought great physical changes. Your hair or skin sometimes appears insubstantial, and you're slighter and more agile than other fetchlings. You're **Small** instead of **Medium**. You gain the trained proficiency rank in Acrobatics, the [[Quick Squeeze]] skill feat, and a +1 circumstance bonus to Acrobatics checks to Tumble Through. If you would automatically become trained in Acrobatics (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice.
