# Sacred Nagaji
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-heritage.svg|150]]

You stand out from most nagaji, with the upper body of a beautiful human and the lower body of a green or white snake. Legends claim your ancestors were faithful snakes uplifted by Nalinivati rather than nagaji created by the goddess. Instead of a fangs unarmed attack, you have a tail attack that deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage, is in the brawling weapon group, and has the finesse and unarmed traits. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your Fortitude or Reflex DC against attempts to [[Grapple]] or [[Trip]] you. This bonus also applies to saving throws against effects that would [[Grabbed|Grab]] you, [[Restrained|Restrain]] you, or knock you [[Prone]].
