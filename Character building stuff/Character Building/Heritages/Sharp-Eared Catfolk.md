You were born with big, expressive ears that move with your moods and perk up at any unexpected sound. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to locate undetected creatures that you could hear within 30 feet with a Seek action.

As long as you're aware of a creature via sound, once per round, your ears can help you [[Point Out]] the creature to all allies as a free action.
