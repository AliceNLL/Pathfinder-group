# Deep Fetchling
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-heritage.svg|150]]

Your predecessors dwelled in the Shadow Plane's deepest, most treacherous regions. You might cast a denser shadow, have a slower pulse, or find comfort in the embrace of darkness. You gain cold or void resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1), chosen when you gain this heritage.
