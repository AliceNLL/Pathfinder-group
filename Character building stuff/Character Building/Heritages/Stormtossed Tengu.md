# Stormtossed Tengu
![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-ancestry-stormtossed-tengu.webp|150]]

Whether due to a blessing from Hei Feng or hatching from your egg during a squall, you are resistant to storms. You gain electricity resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1).

You automatically succeed at the flat check to target a [[Concealed]] creature if that creature is concealed only by rain or fog.
