# Shoreline Strix
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-heritage.svg|150]]

You're the descendant of strix who traveled to the coasts. Your feathers are especially water-repellent and sleekly angled for diving, allowing you to catch fish and other prey in the shallows. You are trained in Athletics, and you gain the [[Underwater Marauder]] skill feat as a bonus skill feat.
