# Death Warden Dwarf
![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-ancestry-death-warden-dwarf.webp|150]]

Your ancestors were tomb guardians, and their power to ward off death passed on to you. If you roll a success on a saving throw against an effect that has the void trait or was created by an undead creature, you get a critical success instead.
