# Woodland Elf
![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-ancestry-woodland-elf.webp|150]]

You're adapted to life in the forest, the deep jungle, or a similar environment, and you know how to climb trees and use foliage to your advantage. When [[Climb|Climbing]] trees, vines, and other foliage, you move at half your Speed on a success and at full Speed on a critical success (and you move at full Speed on a success if you have [[Quick Climb]]). This doesn't affect you if you're using a climb Speed.

You can always use the [[Take Cover]] action when you are within forest terrain to gain cover, even if you're not next to an obstacle you can Take Cover behind.
