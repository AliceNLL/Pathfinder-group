# Seer Elf
![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-ancestry-seer-elf.webp|150]]

You have an inborn ability to detect and understand magical phenomena. You can cast the [[Detect Magic]] cantrip as an arcane innate spell at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell rank equal to half your level rounded up.

In addition, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to checks to [[Identify Magic]] and to [[Decipher Writing]] of a magical nature. These skill actions typically use the Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion skill.
