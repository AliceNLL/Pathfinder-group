# Mountainkeeper Tengu
![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-ancestry-mountainkeeper-tengu.webp|150]]

You come from a line of tengu ascetics, leaving you with a link to the spirits of the world and the Great Beyond. You can cast the _[[Vitality Lash]]_ cantrip as a primal innate spell at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up.

Each time you cast a spell from a tengu heritage or ancestry feat, you can decide whether it's a divine or primal spell.
