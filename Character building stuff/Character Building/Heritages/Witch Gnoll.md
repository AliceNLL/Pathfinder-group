# Witch Gnoll
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-heritage.svg|150]]

You're a shaggy, dark-furred gnoll capable of making some truly uncanny sounds. You can cast the _[[Ghost Sound]]_ cantrip as an occult innate spell at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up. In addition, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to checks to Impersonate and Create a Diversion when using only your voice.
