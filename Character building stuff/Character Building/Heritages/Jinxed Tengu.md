# Jinxed Tengu
![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-ancestry-jinxed-tengu.webp|150]]

Your lineage has been exposed to curse after curse, and now, they slide off your feathers like rain. If you succeed at a saving throw against a curse or misfortune effect, you get a critical success instead.

When you would gain the [[Doomed]] condition, attempt a DC 17 flat check. On a success, reduce the value of the doomed condition you would gain by 1.
