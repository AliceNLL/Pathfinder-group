# Bloodhound Shoony
![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-ancestry-bloodhound-shoony.webp|150]]

Your ancestors were famous trackers, and you carry in your blood that same gift of the hunt.

You gain a special sense: imprecise scent with a range of 30 feet. This means you can use your sense of smell to determine the location of a creature, but it remains [[Hidden]].

In addition, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Survival checks to [[Track]] creatures that you have previously sensed with your scent.
