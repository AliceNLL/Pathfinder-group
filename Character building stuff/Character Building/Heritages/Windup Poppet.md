# Windup Poppet
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-heritage.svg|150]]

You're made primarily of soft metals, such as tin or silver, and your life force dwells within an exceptional array of clockworks deep in your body. Provided you wind metal tabs on your body a few times each day, you don't need food or water to survive. You must still breathe to ventilate your internal mechanisms and sleep to give your mechanisms rest, just like other poppets.
