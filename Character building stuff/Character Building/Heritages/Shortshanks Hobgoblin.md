# Shortshanks Hobgoblin
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-heritage.svg|150]]

You have a longer torso and broader shoulders than most hobgoblins, making your legs seem short by comparison. This gives you a strong, muscular core and lowers your center of gravity—features that assist you in riding and climbing—and you've trained at riding in a saddle from an extremely early age. You gain the [[Ride]] feat. Additionally, you are not [[Off-Guard]] while you Climb.
