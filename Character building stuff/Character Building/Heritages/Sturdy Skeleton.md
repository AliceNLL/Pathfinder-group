# Sturdy Skeleton
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-heritage.svg|150]]

Certain hazardous conditions are not suitable for the average skeleton, so a necromancer might choose to reanimate the bones of a dwarf, orc, or other creature with a reputation for sturdiness. You have 10 Hit Points instead of 6 and gain the [[Diehard]] feat.
