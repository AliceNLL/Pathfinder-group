# Skyborn Tengu
![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-ancestry-skyborn-tengu.webp|150]]

Your bones may be especially light, you may be a rare tengu with wings, or your connection to the spirits of wind and sky might be stronger than most, slowing your descent through the air. You take no damage from falling, regardless of the distance you fall.
