# Duskwalker
![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-ancestry-duskwalker.webp|150]]

Thanks to an ancient bargain, your soul has been reborn as a duskwalker, a planar scion with a connection to psychopomps and the Boneyard. You gain the duskwalker trait in addition to the traits from your ancestry. You also gain [[Low-Light Vision]], or you gain [[Darkvision]] if your ancestry already has low-light vision. Neither your body nor your spirit can ever become undead. You can choose from duskwalker feats and feats from your ancestry whenever you gain an ancestry feat.
