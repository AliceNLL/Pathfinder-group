# Discarded Fleshwarp
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-heritage.svg|150]]

The biomancers and mutagenists who warped your form labeled you a "discard on discovery"â€”a euphemism for destroying you on sight. An anomaly among anomalies, your body stubbornly repudiates the efforts of fleshcrafters seeking to mold you to their grandiose visions, and your immune responses blunt the worst effects of unwanted fleshwarping attempts. If you roll a success on a saving throw against a transmutation effect, you get a critical success instead.
