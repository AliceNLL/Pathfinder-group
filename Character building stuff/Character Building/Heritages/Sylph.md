# Sylph
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-heritage.svg|150]]

You are descended from air elementals or were born under the element's influence. You gain the sylph trait, in addition to the traits from your ancestry. You also gain [[Low-Light Vision]] or [[Darkvision]] if your ancestry already has low-light vision. You can choose from sylph feats and feats from your ancestry whenever you gain an ancestry feat.
