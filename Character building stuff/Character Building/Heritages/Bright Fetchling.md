# Bright Fetchling
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-heritage.svg|150]]

Your body proves that shadow can't exist without light. Perhaps your eyes glow brighter or your veins occasionally pulse with light. You emit dim light within 5 feet of you. You can activate or suppress this ability as an action, which has the concentrate trait. Additionally, you can force fragments of your shadow to glow and cast _[[Light]]_ and _[[Light]]_ as occult innate cantrips. Cantrips are heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up.
