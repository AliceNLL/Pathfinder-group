# Aphorite
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-heritage.svg|150]]

You were born with a connection to Axis, the Plane of Law. You gain the aphorite trait, in addition to the traits from your ancestry. You also gain [[Low-Light Vision]], or you gain [[Darkvision]] if your ancestry already has low-light vision. You can choose from aphorite feats and feats from your ancestry whenever you gain an ancestry feat.
