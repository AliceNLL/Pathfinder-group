# Hunter Automaton
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-heritage.svg|150]]

You were designed to serve as a scout or assassin and have a body resembling a pack hunter like a large cat or wolf. Though you typically move like a quadruped, you can still stand and fight like a biped, allowing you to use all equipment normally. Your quadruped design allows you to move quickly; if you have both hands free, you can increase your Speed to 30 feet as you run on all fours.
