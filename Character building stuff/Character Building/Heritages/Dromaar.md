# Dromaar
![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-ancestry-half-orc.webp|150]]

Orcish strength emboldens your bloodline. You have a green tinge to your skin and other indicators of orc heritage. You gain the orc trait, the dromaar trait, and low-light vision. When you gain an ancestry feat, you can choose from dromaar and orc feats in addition to those from your ancestry.
