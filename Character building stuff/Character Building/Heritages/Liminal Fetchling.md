# Liminal Fetchling
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-heritage.svg|150]]

You come from a line of fetchlings with a closer connection to the Ethereal and Shadow Planes, and you share those realms' affinity with the in-between and unseen. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to locate [[Undetected]] creatures within 60 feet when using the Seek action. Your flat check to target [[Concealed]] creatures is DC 3 flat instead of DC 11.
