# Deep Orc
![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-ancestry-deep-orc.webp|150]]

Your calloused hands and red eyes speak to a life spent in the deep darkness of mountain caverns, where you learned to battle on rocky cliffs and survive with minimal resources. You gain the [[Terrain Expertise]] skill feat for underground terrain and the [[Combat Climber]] skill feat.
