# Rock Dwarf
![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-ancestry-rock-dwarf.webp|150]]

Your ancestors lived and worked among the ancient stones of the mountains or the depths of the earth. This makes you solid as a rock when you plant your feet. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your Fortitude or Reflex DC against attempts to [[Reposition]], [[Shove]], or [[Trip]] you. This bonus also applies to saving throws against spells or effects that attempt to force you to move or knock you [[Prone]].

In addition, if any effect would force you to move 10 feet or more, you are moved only half the distance.
