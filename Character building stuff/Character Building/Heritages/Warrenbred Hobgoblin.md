# Warrenbred Hobgoblin
![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-ancestry-warrenbred-hobgoblin.webp|150]]

Your ancestors lived underground. Your ears are larger than those of other hobgoblins and sensitive to echoes. When you are underground, you can use the [[Seek]] action to sense [[Undetected]] creatures within a 30 foot burst instead of a 15 foot burst. In addition, if you roll a success on an Acrobatics check to [[Squeeze]], you get a critical success instead.
