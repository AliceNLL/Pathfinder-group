# Old-Blood Vishkanya
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-heritage.svg|150]]

You have a direct matrilineal line to the original group of vishkanyas upon the Vudrani ships that came to reclaim Jalmeray. Since then, your family has adjusted well to a new life in the Inner Sea. You become trained in Society (or another skill of your choice if you're already trained in Society), and you gain your choice of the [[Courtly Graces]] or [[Streetwise]] feat.
