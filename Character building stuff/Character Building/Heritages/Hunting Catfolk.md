# Hunting Catfolk
![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-ancestry-hunting-catfolk.webp|150]]

You come from a long line of skilled hunters and trackers and have a particularly keen sense of smell.

You gain imprecise scent with a range of 30 feet. This means you can use your sense of smell to determine a creature's location. The GM will usually double the range if you're downwind from the creature or halve the range if you're upwind.

In addition, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to [[Track]] a creature or object if you've smelled it before.
