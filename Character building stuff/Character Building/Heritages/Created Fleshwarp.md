![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-heritage.svg|150]]

You were created through occult or alchemical processes, such as being grown in a vat or stitched together from the body parts of other creatures by a scientist in Ustalav. Your manufactured body is durable; you don't need to eat and can't starve. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saving throws against diseases.
