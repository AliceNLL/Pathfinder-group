# Titan Nagaji
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-heritage.svg|150]]

You were raised to be a warrior or a bodyguard, and your specialized diet and bulging muscles have made your scales as strong as armored plates. Your scales are medium armor in the plate armor group that grant a +4 item bonus to AC, a Dex cap of +1, a check penalty of –2, a Speed penalty of –5 feet, a Strength value of 16, and have the comfort trait. You can never wear other armor or remove your scales. You can etch armor runes onto your scales.
