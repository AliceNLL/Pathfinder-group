# Forge-Blessed Dwarf
![[icons-tools-smithing-furnace-fire-metal-orange.webp|150]]

You are from a family in Highhelm that venerates a particular dwarven deity above all others. Your birth was blessed by your family's patron deity, granting you a fraction of their power. Choose one deity from the dwarven pantheon. You can cast the 1st-level spell they grant clerics (such as _[[Soothe]]_ if your family's patron is Bolka) as an innate divine spell once per week.
