# Surgewise Fleshwarp
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-heritage.svg|150]]

The undulations of your body's cilia are hyper-attuned to wellsprings of magic; they trill and thrum with insights into occult energies, and their vibrations alert you to the presence of secrets. You gain the trained proficiency rank in Occultism. If you're trained in Occultism, you instead become trained in another skill of your choice. You also gain the [[Oddity Identification]] skill feat.
