# Hillock Halfling

Accustomed to a calm life in the hills, your people find rest and relaxation especially replenishing, particularly when indulging in creature comforts. When you regain Hit Points overnight, add your level to the Hit Points regained. When anyone uses the Medicine skill to [[Treat Wounds|Treat your Wounds]], you can eat a snack to add your level to the Hit Points you regain from their treatment.
