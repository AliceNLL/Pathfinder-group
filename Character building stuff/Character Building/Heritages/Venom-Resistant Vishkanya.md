# Venom-Resistant Vishkanya
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-heritage.svg|150]]

Your body contains not just venom but numerous antivenoms. You gain poison resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1), and each of your successful saving throws against a poison affliction reduces its stage by 2, or by 1 for a virulent poison. Each critical success against an ongoing poison reduces its stage by 3, or by 2 for a virulent poison.
