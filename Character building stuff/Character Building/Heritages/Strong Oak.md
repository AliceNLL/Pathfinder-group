Most ghorans have bodies of pliable vines and tough stems, but you're covered in sturdy, rough bark and your legs are stable as roots. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus on your Fortitude or Reflex DC against attempts to [[Grapple]] or [[Trip]] you. This bonus also applies to saving throws against effects that would [[Grabbed|Grab]] you, [[Restrained|Restrain]] you, or knock you [[Prone]]. You also gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Acrobatics checks to [[Balance]].
