# Dark Fields Kitsune
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-heritage.svg|150]]

You can exert your unsettling presence to subtly Demoralize others. When you do, Demoralize loses the auditory trait and gains the visual trait, and you don't take a penalty when you attempt to Demoralize a creature that doesn't understand your language. You also gain the [[Invigorating Fear]] reaction. Your alternate form is a fox, which has the statistics of 1st-level _[[Pest Form]]_.
