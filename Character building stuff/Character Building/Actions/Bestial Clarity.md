# Bestial Clarity `pf2:r`

**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** You fail a saving throw against an enchantment effect

* * *

**Effect** Your bestial manifestation becomes more pronounced, and your mind gains a flash of clarity as your instincts take over. You can reroll the triggering saving throw with a +2 circumstance bonus, but you must use the new result. This is a fortune effect.
