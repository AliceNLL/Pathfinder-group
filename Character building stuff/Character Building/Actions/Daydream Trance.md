# Daydream Trance
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-entrancing-eyes.webp|150]]

You fall into a half-sleeping trance. This lasts for 1 minute or until you fall [[Unconscious]], whichever comes first. You can voluntarily end your trance by taking a single action, which has a concentrate trait, and succeeding at a DC resolve will save against your own class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. Once your trance ends, you can't enter a Daydream Trance again for 1 minute. While you're in your trance, you gain the following effects:

*   You gain a +1 status bonus to Will saves. This bonus increases to +2 against mental effects. If you're legendary in Occultism, the bonus against mental effects increases to +3.
*   You take a -1 penalty to Perception checks and initiative rolls.
