# Visions of Sin `pf2:2`

**Frequency** once per 10 minutes

Your eidolon summons images of its sin into the mind of a target creature within 30 feet, tormenting and confusing the target. The target must attempt a Will save against your spell DC with the following effects. The effects last until the end of your next turn, but your eidolon can use a single action, which has the concentrate trait, to extend the effects until the end of your next turn (like Sustaining a Spell), to a maximum duration of 1 minute.

If the target is evil, it takes a -2 circumstance penalty to its save. Regardless of whether it succeeds, the target becomes temporarily immune for 1 day.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target can't use reactions.

**Failure** The target is [[Slowed]] and can't use reactions.

**Critical Failure** As failure, and the target is also [[Confused]] for 1 round. The confusion can't be extended, but the other effects can.
