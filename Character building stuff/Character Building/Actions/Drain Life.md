If the Strike hits and deals damage, the target must attempt a Fortitude save, with the following effects. On a critical hit, the enemy uses the result one degree worse than it rolled.

**Critical Success** No effect.

**Success** Your eidolon drains a small amount of life force. The enemy takes additional void damage equal to half your level.
