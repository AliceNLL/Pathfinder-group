# Gather Information
![[systems-pf2e-icons-actions-Passive.webp|150]]

You canvass local markets, taverns, and gathering places in an attempt to learn about a specific individual or topic. The GM determines the DC of the Diplomacy check and the amount of time it takes (typically 2 hours, but sometimes more), along with any benefit you might be able to gain by spending coin on bribes, drinks, or gifts.

* * *

**Success** You collect information about the individual or topic. The GM determines the specifics.

**Critical Failure** You collect incorrect information about the individual or topic.

## Sample Gather Information Tasks

*   **Untrained** talk of the town
*   **Trained** common rumor
*   **Expert** obscure rumor, poorly guarded secret
*   **Master** well-guarded or esoteric information
*   **Legendary** information known only to an incredibly select few, or only to extraordinary beings
