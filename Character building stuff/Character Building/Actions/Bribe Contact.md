# Bribe Contact
![[systems-pf2e-icons-actions-Passive.webp|150]]

**Cost** A bribe worth at least one-tenth of the Currency per Additional PC listed on Core Rulebook 509 (see table below). Doubling this amount grants a +2 circumstance bonus to the check.

**Requirements** You've successfully Gained a Contact. You offer a bribe to your contact to help the heist in some way. Attempt a hard or very hard Deception or Diplomacy check.

* * *

**Success** The contact accepts the bribe and you gain 1 EP.

**Failure** You believe you successfully Bribed your Contact and gained 1 EP, but in fact the contact informs the opposition of the attempted bribery, adding 1 AP to the infiltration. The GM can reveal that this Edge Point grants no benefit at any point during the infiltration, as befits the story.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but adding 2 AP to the infiltration.
