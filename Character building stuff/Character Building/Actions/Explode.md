# Explode `pf2:2`

You intentionally take your innovation beyond normal safety limits, making it explode and damage nearby creatures without damaging the innovation... hopefully. The explosion deals 2d6 fire with a DC 0 resolve reflex around you (if you're wearing or holding the innovation) or around your innovation (if your innovation is a minion).

At 3rd level, and every level thereafter, increase your explosion's damage by 1d6.

If you have the breakthrough innovation class feature, you can choose either a 5-foot or 10 foot emanation for the area when you use Explode; if you have the revolutionary innovation class feature, you can choose a 5-foot, 10-foot, or 15 foot emanation.

DC 17 flat{Unstable Check}

On a failure, the innovation malfunctions in a spectacular (though harmless) fashion, such as a belch of smoke or shower of sparks, and it becomes incapable of being used for further unstable actions.

On a critical failure, you also take fire damage equal to your level.
