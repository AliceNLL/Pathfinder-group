# Sense Direction
![[systems-pf2e-icons-actions-Passive.webp|150]]

Using the stars, the position of the sun, traits of the geography or flora, or the behavior of fauna, you can stay oriented in the wild. Typically, you attempt a Survival check only once per day, but some environments or changes might necessitate rolling more often. The GM determines the DC and how long this activity takes (usually just a minute or so). More unusual locales or those you're unfamiliar with might require you to have a minimum proficiency rank to Sense Direction. Without a [[Compass]], you take a -2 item penalty to checks to Sense Direction.

**Critical Success** You get an excellent sense of where you are. If you are in an environment with cardinal directions, you know them exactly.

**Success** You gain enough orientation to avoid becoming hopelessly lost. If you are in an environment with cardinal directions, you have a sense of those directions.

## Sample Sense Direction Tasks

*   **Untrained** determine a cardinal direction using the sun
*   **Trained** find an overgrown path in a forest
*   **Expert** navigate a hedge maze
*   **Master** navigate a byzantine labyrinth or relatively featureless desert
*   **Legendary** navigate an ever-changing dream realm
