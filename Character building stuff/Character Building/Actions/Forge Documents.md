![[systems-pf2e-icons-actions-Passive.webp|150]]

You prepare forgeries that might serve as convincing props. Attempt a hard or very hard Society check.

* * *

**Success** You create convincing forgeries and gain 1 EP you can use only when presenting some form of paperwork.

**Failure** You create unconvincing documents. You gain 1 EP that (unknown to you) grants no benefit when used.

**Critical Failure** As a failure, but a PC who tries to use the Edge Point gets a critical failure, even if they use the Edge Point after rolling a failure.
