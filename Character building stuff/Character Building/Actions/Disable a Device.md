# Disable a Device `pf2:2`

This action allows you to disarm a trap or another complex device. Often, a device requires numerous successes before becoming disabled, depending on its construction and complexity. A [[Thieves' Toolkit]] is helpful and sometimes even required to Disable a Device, as determined by the GM, and sometimes a device requires a higher proficiency rank in Thievery to disable it.

Your Thievery check result determines how much progress you make.

* * *

**Critical Success** You disable the device, or you achieve two successes toward disabling a complex device. You leave no trace of your tampering, and you can rearm the device later, if that type of device can be rearmed.

**Success** You disable the device, or you achieve one success toward disabling a complex device.

**Critical Failure** You trigger the device.
