# Spring the Trap `pf2:0`

**Trigger** You roll initiative.

* * *

You can Interact to draw a combination weapon and set it to melee or ranged mode. On your first turn, your movement and ranged attacks don't trigger reactions that are normally triggered by movement or a ranged attack (such as Attack of Opportunity).
