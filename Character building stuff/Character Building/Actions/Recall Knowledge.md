You attempt a skill check to try to remember a bit of knowledge regarding a topic related to that skill. Suggest which skill you'd like to use and ask the GM one question. The GM determines the DC.

**Critical Success** You recall the knowledge accurately. The GM answers your question truthfully and either tells you additional information or context, or answers one follow-up question.
