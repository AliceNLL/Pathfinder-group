**Trigger** You start your turn in combat against a foe or foes you recognize to be fiends

**Frequency** once per day

**Effect** You gain a +1 status bonus on all Strikes or spell attack rolls against fiends for the duration of combat. Once during combat, you can draw a harrow card after you determine if a Strike or spell attack on a fiend hits but before you determine damage or effects caused to the fiend.
