![[systems-pf2e-icons-actions-Passive.webp|150]]

You strain yourself to move at double your travel speed. You can Hustle only for a number of minutes equal to your Constitution modifier Ã— 10 (minimum 10 minutes). If you are in a group that is Hustling, use the lowest Constitution modifier among everyone to determine how fast the group can Hustle together.
