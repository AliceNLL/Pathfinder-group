# Borrow an Arcane Spell
![[systems-pf2e-icons-actions-Passive.webp|150]]

If you're an arcane spellcaster who prepares from a spellbook, you can attempt to prepare a spell from someone else's spellbook. The GM sets the DC for the check based on the spell's level and rarity; it's typically a bit easier than [[Learn a Spell|Learning the Spell]].

* * *

**Success** You prepare the borrowed spell as part of your normal spell preparation.

**Failure** You fail to prepare the spell, but the spell slot remains available for you to prepare a different spell. You can't try to prepare this spell until the next time you prepare spells.
