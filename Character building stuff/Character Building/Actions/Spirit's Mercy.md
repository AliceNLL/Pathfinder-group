# Spirit's Mercy `pf2:r`

**Trigger** You take vitality or void damage, or you take any type of damage caused by a haunt, ghost, or other incorporeal undead

**Cost** 1 spirit wisp or remnant

* * *

**Effect** You purify a spirit by having it perform a final act of mercy to lessen the damage caused by another spirit. This grants you resistance to vitality and void damage (or resistance to all damage if caused by a haunt or incorporeal undead) against the triggering effect. If you expend a spirit wisp, the resistance is equal to twice your level. If you expend a spirit remnant, the resistance is equal to three times the level of the incorporeal undead or haunt from which you gained the remnant.
