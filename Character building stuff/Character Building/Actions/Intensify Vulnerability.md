# Intensify Vulnerability `pf2:1`

**Prerequisites** Exploit Vulnerability

**Frequency** once per round

**Requirements** You're benefiting from Exploit Vulnerability, you can see the subject, and you haven't used Exploit Vulnerability this round.

* * *

You present your implement and esoterica again, intensifying their effects on the target in a way unique to your implement. You gain the intensified vulnerability benefit from one of the implements you're holding, which lasts until the beginning of your next turn.
