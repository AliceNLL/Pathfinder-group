# Resist Magic `pf2:r`

**Trigger** You attempt a saving throw against a harmful magical effect but haven't rolled yet.

* * *

Your innate magic protects you. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the triggering saving throw. Additionally, if the triggering effect is arcane, if you roll a success, you get a critical success instead.
