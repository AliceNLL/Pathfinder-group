# Summoner
![[systems-pf2e-icons-classes-summoner.webp|150]]

_You can magically beckon a powerful being called an eidolon to your side, serving as the mortal conduit that anchors it to the world. Whether your eidolon is a friend, a servant, or even a personal god, your connection to it marks you as extraordinary, shaping the course of your life dramatically._

_[[Summoner]]_
