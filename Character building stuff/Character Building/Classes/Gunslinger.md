# Gunslinger
![[systems-pf2e-icons-classes-gunslinger.webp|150]]

_While some fear projectile weapons, you savor the searing flash, wild kick, and cloying smoke that accompanies a gunshot, or snap of the cable and telltale thunk of your crossbow just before your bolt finds purchase. Ready to draw a bead on an enemy at every turn, you rely on your reflexes, steady hand, and knowledge of your weapons to riddle your foes with holes._

_[[Gunslinger]]_
