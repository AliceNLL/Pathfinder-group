**Usage** affixed to armor, shield, or weapon

**Activate** F envision

**Trigger** The affixed object would take damage

This small pebble is strangely dense and surprisingly durable, affixed to an object by a sturdy steel chain. When you activate the pebble, the affixed object takes 10 less damage.
