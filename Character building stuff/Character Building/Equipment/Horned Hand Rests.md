![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-worn-items-companion-items-horned-hand-rests.webp|150]]

These thick bull or ram horns fuse into the armrests of your legchair companion, giving it more aggressive options. Your animal companion can only invest this item if it is a legchair.

**Activate** 1 or 2 envision

**Frequency** once per minute

**Effect** You trace your finger along the base of the ram horns, with an effect depending on how many actions you spent.

1 Your legchair draws force from its momentum. Until the end of this turn, if your legchair Strides, it deals 2d6 additional force damage on its next Strike and, on a critical success, pushes the target away by 5 feet.

2 Your legchair fires a beam of force from its ram horns. The target takes 4d6 force damage and must attempt a DC 22 fortitude save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target takes half damage and is pushed 5 feet.

**Failure** The target takes full damage and is pushed 10 feet.

**Critical Failure** The target takes double damage and is pushed 20 feet.
