# Rotary Bow
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-weapon.svg|150]]

This one-handed crossbow has four arms instead of two, and four rotating chambers that can be pre-loaded with bolts for more efficient firing. The chamber can be swapped and the arms redrawn with a simple crank device built into the crossbow.
