# Wand of Tormented Slumber
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-equipment.svg|150]]

The carved talon of an unidentifiable beast comprises this wand. Blood-stained cloth wraps the thicker part of the talon, which acts as a handle.

**Activate** Cast a Spell

**Frequency** once per day, plus overcharge

**Effect** You cast 4th-level _[[Sleep]]_, but the slumbering creatures have terrifying nightmares. A creature knocked [[Unconscious]] by this spell takes 1d6 persistent,mental. This damage wakes the creature from unconsciousness only if it deals 4 or more damage on a single roll. If the creature awakens from its unconsciousness due to damage (whether it was the persistent mental damage or not), it's [[Frightened|Frightened 1]]. If it awakens from damage on its own turn, the creature doesn't reduce its frightened condition automatically on that turn.
