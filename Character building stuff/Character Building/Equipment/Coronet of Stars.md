This short golden crown bears a number of gems, each placed in the center of an engraving of a star. While wearing the crown, you are overcome with a nurturing instinct and understand the best ways to help others. You gain a +3 item bonus to Medicine checks. When you invest the crown, you either increase your Wisdom score by 2 or increase it to 18, whichever would give you a higher score.
