# Privacy Ward Fulu (Hallway)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-consumables-fulus-fulu-fancy.webp|150]]

This fulu seeks to keep thieves, spies, and unwanted attention away from a room. A depiction of a lock appears in the center of this fulu, which is in turn surrounded by circles of broken keys. When applied to a wall inside a room, all creatures within the room gain an item bonus to Stealth checks against creatures outside the room.

The privacy ward fulu can shield a room of up to 10 square feet, grants a +1 item bonus, and has a duration of 1 hour.
