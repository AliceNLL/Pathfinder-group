# Silver Crescent (Lesser)
![[icons-consumables-food-candy-taffy-blue-white.webp|150]]

A piquant tamarind and chili-lime flavor infuses a silver crescent, which was first created to aid those battling the undead. For 1 hour, you shed cool, white light like a torch, and you gain a +1 item bonus to saving throws against olfactory effects. While shedding this light, you can't be [[Concealed]] if you're visible, and if you're [[Invisible]], you're concealed instead rather than being undetected.

**Secondary Effect** 2

**Effect** A ray of light descends on a 5-foot square of your choice within 120 feet. Any creature in that space takes 4d6 vitality with a DC 20 Basic reflex and is [[Dazzled]] until the end of its next turn on a failed save. This is treated as silver for the purposes of weaknesses, resistances, and the like. The silver crescent becomes inert.
