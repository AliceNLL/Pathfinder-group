This thick leather belt is engraved with imagery of an ancient tree. You gain 15 temporary Hit Points the first time you invest the belt in a day. When you invest the belt, you either increase your Constitution modifier by 1 or increase it to +4, whichever would give you a higher value.

**Activateâ€”Call Upon the Ancient Life** 1 (manipulate)

**Frequency** once per day

**Effect** You draw upon the lifegiving energy of the tree on the belt to gain rapid healing. For `dice: 2d4` rounds, at the start of your turn each round, you recover 15 Hit Points.
