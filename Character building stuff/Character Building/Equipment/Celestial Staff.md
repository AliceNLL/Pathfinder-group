# Celestial Staff
![[icons-weapons-staves-staff-winged-red.webp|150]]

Heavenly radiance shines from an active celestial staff, a golden staff capped with a pair of sculpted angel's wings. Used as a weapon, the staff is a _+2 greater striking holy staff_. While wielding a _celestial staff_, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against effects that have the evil trait and effects created by evil creatures. When you prepare this staff, if you're evil, you become [[Drained 1]] until your next daily preparations.
