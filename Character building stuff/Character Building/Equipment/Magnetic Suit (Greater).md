If set to repel, you gain a +2 item bonus to AC against attacks made with metal weapons. While attracting metal, you gain a +2 item bonus to Athletics checks to [[Climb]] metal objects and [[Grapple]] metal creatures and a -2 item penalty to Athletics checks to [[Shove]] metal creatures. While repelling metal, you gain a +2 item bonus to Athletics checks to Shove metal creatures, but you take a -2 item penalty to Climb metal objects and Grapple metal creatures.
