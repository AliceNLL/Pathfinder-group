# Spider Lily Tattoo
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-tattoos-warding-tattoo.webp|150]]

The spider lily tattoo marks you as a trusted member of Granny Hu's network. This crimson tattoo fades and becomes [[Invisible]] within a day of being applied, reappearing only when you Activate it, when you gain the [[Doomed]] condition, or when you die. The higher the doomed value, the more vivid the color.

If your tattoo is plainly visible, you gain a +1 item bonus to Intimidation checks against all creatures that can see the tattoo, but you take a –1 item penalty to Diplomacy checks to [[Make an Impression]] on those who understand the actual meaning of the spider lily tattoo (including all of Willowshore's citizens).

**Activate** f envision (concentrate)

**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** An undead creature detects you for the first time

**Effect** The spider lily tattoo manipulates your life force to make you appear to be undead for a short time. Attempt a deception check against the triggering undead creature's Perception DC. On a success, the triggering undead believes you're undead as well—a mindless undead is likely to ignore you, while a sapient undead might react with curiosity or confusion. You can continue attempting Deception checks each round as a single action to Sustain the effect for up to 1 minute.
