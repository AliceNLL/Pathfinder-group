# Solar Shellflower
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-weapons-flintlock-musket.webp|150]]

This _+1 striking flintlock musket_ features multiple triangular panels that can be folded out of the stock, like the petals of a tigridia flower, that collect sunlight and feed it into the spark gun's core. All damage dealt by a _solar shellflower_ is fire damage.

**Activate** 1 Interact

**Frequency** once per day (but see below)

* * *

**Effect** One of the panels from the _solar shellflower_ detaches and unfurls into a tigridia-shaped construct of flame. For the next 1 minute, whenever you Strike an enemy with the _solar shellflower_, the construct fires a smaller jet of fire that automatically hits the target, dealing 3d4 persistent,fire{3d4 additional persistent fire damage} or twice that on a critical hit. The _solar shellflower_ usually requires a full day to replenish enough solar energy to recharge this Activation, but if used in an environment with especially strong sunlight, such as in a desert, cliff above the clouds, or near the summer solstice, it can recharge in 1 hour instead.
