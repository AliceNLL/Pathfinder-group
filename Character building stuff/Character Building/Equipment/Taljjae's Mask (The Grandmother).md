# Taljjae's Mask (The Grandmother)
![[icons-equipment-head-mask-horned-brown.webp|150]]

Those who gain one of Taljjae's masks, either by defeating Taljjae or some other means, are known as its understudies and gain a fraction of its power. Each of Taljjae's masks is an 18th-level unique item with the invested and magical traits; if broken, they're automatically repaired to full HP when invested during daily preparations. The effect of a mask on a PC is noted in the mask's Understudy entry. Wearing one of Taljjae's masks also imposes Taljjae's jelly sense and jelly gluttony on the creature as long as it wears the mask.

The _Grandmother_ allows its wearer to cast 8th-level _[[Heal]]_ and 7th-level _[[Breath of Life]]_, each as a divine innate spell, once per day.
