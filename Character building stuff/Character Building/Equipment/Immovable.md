# Immovable
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-runes-armor-property-runes-armor-property-runes.webp|150]]

This rune utilizes magical principles used in an _[[Immovable Rod]]_.

**Activate** 1 Interact

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** Your armor anchors you in place, even defying gravity, rendering you [[Immobilized]] until you Dismiss the Activation. While you're immobilized in this way, you can be moved only if a creature succeeds at a DC 40 athletics check to [[Force Open]] your armor. You can also be moved if 8,000 pounds of pressure are placed upon you, though this is likely fatal.
