# Snagging
![[icons-commodities-treasure-token-runed-os-grey.webp|150]]

This animated item attempts to catch you when you fall. You can attempt to [[Grab an Edge]], even if your hands are tied behind your back or otherwise [[Restrained]], so long as there's a solid edge within 10 feet. If you roll a success, you can Grab the Edge even if you don't have a hand free.
