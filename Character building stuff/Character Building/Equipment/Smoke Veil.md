# Smoke Veil
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-equipment.svg|150]]

_Smoke veils_ are wigs or headdresses made of flame and ash, giving the wearer a burning coil of fiery hair and concealing their face behind a smoldering, omnipresent haze of smoke and sparking embers. You can use the veil to go unrecognized by hiding your face so that you can attempt Deception checks to [[Impersonate]] without needing a disguise kit. When you do so, it takes you only 1 minute to create the disguise, and you gain a +1 item bonus to the check. You still need a disguise kit and the full time if you're using cosmetics and other props to change other aspects of your disguise, or if Impersonating a specific person.

**Activateâ€”Blazing Stare** 1 (concentrate)

**Requirements** You dealt fire damage to a target you can see within 30 feet with your most recent action this turn

**Effect** You set your fiery gaze on your target, eyes burning within a cloud of ash and cinder. Roll an Intimidation check to [[Demoralize]] the target. Demoralize loses the auditory trait and gains the visual trait, and you don't take a penalty when you attempt to Demoralize a creature that doesn't understand your language.
