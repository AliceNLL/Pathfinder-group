# Aged Assassin Vine Wine

**Activate** 1 Interact

Crafting wine from assassin vine berries is a dangerous process, but the resulting ruby-red drink is rich and heady. Alchemical reagents added during fermentation concentrate the vine's connection to its environment and impart them onto the imbiber. For 1 minute after drinking a glass of assassin vine wine, you have tremorsense at a range of 30 feet.

Assassin vine wine that has been aged for several years—or artificially aged with alchemy—develops both a greater complexity of flavor and a stronger connection to an assassin vine's bond with nature. When you drink the wine, vegetation in a 20 foot emanation around you begins to writhe, becoming difficult terrain until the start of your next turn.
