![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-held-items-doll.webp|150]]

Dolls are found throughout Golarion in a wide variety of forms. Among the most common are miniature painted figurines, plush animals crafted from fur and stuffed with cotton, porcelain dolls with fine clothing and silky hair, fabric hand puppets, and elaborate marionettes.

Hiding an object inside this beautifully crafted surprise doll grants you a +1 item bonus on Stealth checks made to [[Conceal an Object|Conceal an item]], as the compartment is particularly well-hidden and weighted to ensure the doll doesn't feel off-balance with an item inside.
