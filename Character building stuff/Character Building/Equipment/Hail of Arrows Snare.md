# Hail of Arrows Snare
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-snares-hail-of-arrows-snare.webp|150]]

When a creature enters the snare's square, it releases hundreds upon hundreds of carefully prepared arrows, blanketing a 20-foot radius around the snare's square with massive arrow fire that deals 18d6 piercing damage. Creatures in the area must attempt a DC 37 Basic reflex saving throw.
