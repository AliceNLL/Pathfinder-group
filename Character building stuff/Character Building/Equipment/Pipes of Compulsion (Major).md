# Pipes of Compulsion (Major)
![[icons-tools-instruments-flute-simple-wood.webp|150]]

These panpipes are made of what seems to be beat-up tin bound by frayed leather and look like they shouldn't function at all, but in skilled hands they emit a beautiful sound that beguiles the senses. While playing the pipes, you gain a +2 item bonus to Diplomacy and Performance checks.
