This +1 striking [[Ghost Touch]] crossbow has an array of crystalline lenses and silver fittings along the stock and feels strangely light.

**Activate** 1 envision

**Effect** You aim through the crossbow's crystalline lenses, gaining imprecise vision onto the _Ethereal Plane_ with a range of 60 feet in addition to your normal senses for the rest of your turn. While this effect lasts, your next Strike with the _spiritsight crossbow_ can also affect targets on the Ethereal Plane during the first 60 feet of its flight.
