# Bastion of the Inheritor
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-armor-bastion-plate.webp|150]]

Worn by Iomedae's prestigious knights, this _+2 resilient bastion plate_ is emblazoned with the Inheritor's religious symbol and sports a white cloak. While the cloak is white, this armor grants you a +2 item bonus to Diplomacy checks to [[Make an Impression]], provided your target has no enmity toward Iomedae.

**Activate** 1 command

* * *

**Effect** The armor's cloak becomes red for 1 minute. As long as the cloak is red, you gain the benefits of the armor's deflect melee trait without needing to spend an additional action to activate it during each turn.

**Craft Requirements** You worship Iomedae.
