# Thieves' Toolkit
![[icons-tools-hand-lockpicks-steel-grey.webp|150]]

You need a thieves' toolkit to [[Pick a Lock|Pick Locks]] or [[Disable a Device|Disable Devices]] (of some types) using the Thievery skill.

If your thieves' toolkit is broken, you can repair it by replacing the lock picks with [[Thieves' Toolkit (Replacement Picks)|Replacement Picks]] appropriate to your toolkit; this doesn't require using the Repair action. If you wear your thieves' toolkit, you can draw and replace it as part of the action that uses it.
