# Lucky Kitchen Witch
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-equipment.svg|150]]

This small doll in the shape of a witch is made from sticks and clad in a simple dress, bonnet, and wooden shoes. It sits astride a miniature straw broom. When hung in a kitchen, the witch brings good luck and protects a cook from malicious spirits. The _lucky kitchen witch_ must hang in a kitchen for a week to give any benefit.

When you have a _lucky kitchen witch_ hung in your kitchen, you can reroll a Cooking Lore or Crafting check made during downtime to make food, [[Earn Income]], or Craft an alchemical item in your kitchen.
