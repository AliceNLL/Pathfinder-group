# Rungu
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-weapons-rungu.webp|150]]

This specialized club is designed for throwing and is useful for both combat and hunting. Rungus were invented by Zenj humans of the Mwangi Expanse and are most common among their tribes, though gripplis have also adopted rungus for hunting creatures that hide high in treetops.
