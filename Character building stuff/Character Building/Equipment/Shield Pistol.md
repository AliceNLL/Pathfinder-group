# Shield Pistol
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-weapon.svg|150]]

These unique firearms are designed to attach to shields while still firing normally. Shield pistols are popular among Firebrands in the Shackles as they allow them to hold a blade and a firearm in each hand without giving up on defense. As is normal with firearms, a character doesn't have access to shield pistols unless they separately have access to firearms.
