# Chain of the Stilled Spirit
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-held-items-chain-of-the-stilled-spirit.webp|150]]

This 3-foot length of chain is made of a mystical blue-white steel. You can wrap the chain around an item or creature; if a ghost of 9th level or lower is bound to the item or creature via its rejuvenation ability, it cannot rejuvenate if it is destroyed. This chain can't impede a ghost's rejuvenation that is tied to an area, only to an item or creature. At the GM's discretion, the_chain of the stilled spirit_might work on abilities similar to Rejuvenation that prevent a spirit from going being fully destroyed.
