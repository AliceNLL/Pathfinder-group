**Suit** Crown (Cha)

**Alignment** neutral good

_The Theater_ represents prophecy and how prophets can't change the unfolding pageantry of fate. As long as you have _The Theater_ invested and as long as you are not already [[Doomed]], when you would gain the doomed condition, attempt a DC 10 flat. On a success, you do not gain the doomed condition.

**Activate** r (fortune) envision

**Trigger** You are targeted by a misfortune effect

**Frequency** once per hour

* * *

**Effect** The Theater attempts to counter the misfortune effect before it affects you. It has a counteract level equal to your level divided by 2 (rounded up), and a counteract modifier of your Class DC â€“ 10.
