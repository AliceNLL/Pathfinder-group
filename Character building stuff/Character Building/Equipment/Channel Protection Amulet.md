# Channel Protection Amulet
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-worn-items-other-worn-items-channel-protection-amulet.webp|150]]

This nugget of polished tektite is trapped in a cage of braided wire and hangs from a silken cord. When wearing this amulet, you gain resistance 5 against damage from _[[Harm]]_ spells if you're living, or against _[[Heal]]_ spells if you're undead.
