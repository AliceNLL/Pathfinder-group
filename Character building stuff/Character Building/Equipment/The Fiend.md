# The Fiend
![[icons-sundries-gaming-playing-cards-grey.webp|150]]

**Suit** Hammer (Str)

**Alignment** lawful evil

* * *

_The Fiend_ represents the inevitability of great calamities and pervasive dangers. As long as you have _The Fiend_ invested, when you repeat a non-Strike action you previously took in the same round, you gain a +2 item bonus to checks to perform that action. This increases to a +3 item bonus if you are at least 17th level.

**Activate** 2 envision, Interact

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** You wave the card to create a vision of destruction around you; you cast _[[Phantasmal Calamity]]_, except the area is a 20 foot emanation. The level of the spell is one-half your level, rounded down (minimum 6th level), and the save DC is your class DC or spell DC (DC resolve will). You are immune to the effects of your own phantasmal calamity.
