# Putrid Sack of Rotting Fruit
![[icons-containers-bags-sack-worn-brown.webp|150]]

**Activate** 1 Strike

* * *

Each of these unassuming sacks contains enough rotting fruit to provide a fungus leshy with 1 week's worth of rations, along with clusters of stones to help press out the fruit's juices. Since their last adventure, Reaching Rings has refined their rations's ability to serve as a weapon in addition to delicious, flavorful sustenance.

A sack of rotting fruit has a range increment of 20 feet. When you succeed at a ranged Strike on a creature by hurling a putrid sack of rotten fruit at them, the sack is consumed while the creature takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage and must attempt a DC 17 fortitude save.

**Success** The creature is unaffected by the foul smell of the fruit.

**Failure** The creature becomes [[Sickened 1]].

**Critical Failure** The creature becomes [[Sickened 1|Sickened 2]].
