# Black Powder (Keg)

**Activate** 1 Interact

Black powder is a volatile and explosive alchemical substance commonly used in the production of firearm munitions. Black powder becomes inert and useless when wet and must be kept in a sealed, water-tight container.

A keg contains 5,000 doses of black powder and can be detonated in the same way as a [[Black Powder (Horn)]]. As long as the keg is mostly full (at least 4,000 doses remaining) this deals 3d6 fire damage in a 20 foot burst (DC 20 reflex save). Detonating multiple kegs can increase the area, but not the damage, of this effect; detonating a keg and any horns at the same time in an overlapping area also doesn't increase the damage.
