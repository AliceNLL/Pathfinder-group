# Rite of Reinforcement Exoskeleton
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-armor.svg|150]]

**Note** Conrasu Rite of Reinforcement Heritage Only

* * *

Your woven exoskeleton rivals the hardest armors that can be found. Your exoskeleton is medium armor in the plate armor group that grants a +4 item bonus to AC, a Dex cap of +1, a check penalty of -2, a speed penalty of -5 feet, and a Strength value of 16, and has the comfort trait. You can never wear other armor or remove your exoskeleton. You can etch armor runes onto your exoskeleton as normal.
