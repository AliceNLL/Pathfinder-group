This salt scrub is infused with citron juice and alchemical ingredients that allow it to fight rust on metallic equipment. One application can be used to restore `dice: 2d4` Hit Points to an item that has been damaged by rust. The GM determines what portion of damage to an item was caused by rust if that value isn't known.
