# Perfected Robes
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-equipment.svg|150]]

These unadorned white robes, fastened with simple brass pins in the shape of a human hand, can't be soiled or blemished. While wearing _perfected robes_, you don't need to eat, sleep, or drink, but you can if you choose to. The robes bless you with constant _[[Truesight]]_ (+32 counteract bonus). A creature who dons these robes without earning them is [[Clumsy 1|Clumsy 3]], [[Enfeebled 1|Enfeebled 3]], and [[Stupefied|Stupefied 3]] while wearing them, gaining the true seeing but otherwise unable to use the robes' magic.
