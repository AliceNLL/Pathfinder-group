# Colorful Coating (Orange)

**Activate** 3 Interact

These coatings come in different colors, each with a different special effect. A bottle of colorful coating contains enough to slather over one 5-foot square within your reach or space and is made with a special dispenser that enables you to coat the surface using only one hand. It's possible to use the coating on any surface that can be painted (subject to the GM's discretion). Colorful coating dries instantly, and its effect in the square you coated lasts for 1 minute. After that time, the coating turns to fine, inert powder, returning the square to its original condition unless otherwise noted.

Orange colorful coating contains a mixture of acidic substances. As it dries, caustic ingredients rise to the coating's surface. The square becomes hazardous terrain, dealing 1d4 acid to any creature that moves through it. A creature can take this acid damage only once per round.
