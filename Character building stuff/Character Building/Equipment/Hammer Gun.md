# Hammer Gun
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-weapons-hammer-gun.webp|150]]

This weapon, favored by dwarves and those who like smashing and shooting, takes the form of a stoutly built gun designed similarly to an arquebus with a hammer head built into the muzzle, decreasing kickback but limiting range.
