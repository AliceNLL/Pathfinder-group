# Caltrop Snare
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-snares-caltrop-snare.webp|150]]

This snare consists of a hidden canister of caltrops attached to a trip wire. When the snare is triggered, it flings the caltrops into either the snare's square or a square adjacent to the snare. You choose which square when you set up the snare.

If the caltrops scatter into the same square as a creature, that creature must attempt the Acrobatics check immediately.

**Craft Requirements** Supply a container of caltrops.
