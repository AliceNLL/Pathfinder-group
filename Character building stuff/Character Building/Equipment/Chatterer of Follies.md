# Chatterer of Follies
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-weapons-specific-magic-weapons-chatterer-of-follies.webp|150]]

This heavy +1 striking khakarra is cast from solid steel and plated with pyrite. Metal charms shaped like grinning idols festoon its great arched ring, and during combat, as tiny tendrils of flame fly off the pyrite, these hanging dolls seem to chatter in tune with the clash and din of battle.

Whenever you complete a move action during your turn, choose a creature adjacent to you at the end of your movement. Until the end of your turn, that creature takes a -1 status penalty to Will saves against your enchantment spells and your illusion spells. Any time you cast your enchantment and illusion spells, you become [[Concealed]] during your move actions for the rest of the turn.
