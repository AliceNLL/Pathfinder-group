# Impactful
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-runes-weapon-property-runes-weapon-property-runes.webp|150]]

This rune thrums with pure magical energy. Weapons with the rune deal an additional 1d6 force damage on a successful Strike. On a critical hit, you can choose to force the target to succeed at a DC 27 fortitude save or be pushed 5 feet away from you.
