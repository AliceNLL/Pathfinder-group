# Cloak of the Bat (Greater)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-worn-items-other-worn-items-cloak-of-the-bat.webp|150]]

Sewn from several long strips of luxurious brown and black silk, this cloak grants you a +3 item bonus to Stealth checks as well as to Acrobatics checks to [[Maneuver in Flight]]. You can also use your feet to hang from any surface that can support your weight, without requiring any check, though you still must attempt Athletics checks to [[Climb]] in order to move around while inverted.

**Activate** D command, Interact

**Frequency** any number of times per day

**Effect** You can either transform the cloak into bat-like wings that grant you a fly Speed of 30 feet for 10 minutes, or have the cloak turn you into a bat by casting a 4th-level _[[Pest Form]]_ spell on you.
