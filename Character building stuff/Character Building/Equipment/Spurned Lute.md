# Spurned Lute
![[icons-tools-instruments-lute-gold-brown.webp|150]]

Made of a deep-brown rosewood, a spurned lute is adorned with carved flowers. The lute appears to be and functions as a virtuoso instrument. (Other spurned instruments exist, but the lute is the least rare.) This lute has a jealous streak, demanding total loyalty from its "partner" musician. After you play the lute for the first time, it fuses to you. If you go a day without using it to [[Perform]], you become [[Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] until you next do so. After that, when you attempt a Performance check using an instrument other than the lute, you take a â€“4 circumstance penalty to do so, and you must succeed at a DC 20 will save or become stupefied 1 for 1 minute.
