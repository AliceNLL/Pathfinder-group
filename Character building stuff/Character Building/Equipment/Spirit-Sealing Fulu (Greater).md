# Spirit-Sealing Fulu (Greater)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-consumables-fulus-fulu-fancy.webp|150]]

**Usage** affixed to one undead creature

**Duration** 1 round or 4 rounds

* * *

This classic fulu seals the void energy within an undead, freezing it in its tracks. Upon affixing, the target undead must attempt a DC 27 will save or be [[Paralyzed]] for 1 round. On a critical failure, the undead is paralyzed for 4 rounds. At the end of each of its turns, it can attempt a new Will save to reduce the remaining duration by 1 round, or end it entirely on a critical success.
