# Shielding Salve
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-consumables-oils-shielding-salve.webp|150]]

**Activate** 1 Interact

This shimmering paste has many properties of a _shield_ spell. When you slather it onto a creature or object, the target gains a +1 circumstance bonus to AC for 1 round.

The first time a physical attack or a magic missile hits the target during that round, the oil prevents 5 damage from that attack or spell, and then the oil's effect ends.
