# Standard of the Primeval Howl
![[icons-sundries-flags-banner-standard-brown.webp|150]]

These standards are always constructed from uncut wood and a leather banner painted with the visage of a snarling beastâ€”a wolf, boar, bear, lion, dragon, or similarly imposing creature. And while it might become lost on a battlefield scattered with gaudier standards, its effect bolsters those around a competent leader. When carrying this banner, you gain a +1 item bonus to Intimidation checks and initiative rolls, and creatures in a 20 foot emanation also gain a +1 item bonus to initiative checks.
