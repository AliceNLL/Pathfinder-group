**Activate** F (concentrate)

**Trigger** You make an attack with the affixed weapon, but you haven't rolled yet

* * *

This fluorite crystal glows with a strange phosphorescence. When you activate the crystal, the weapon becomes a _+1 striking weapon_ on the Strike and until the end of this turn, gaining a +1 item bonus to the attack roll and increasing the damage to two weapon damage dice.
