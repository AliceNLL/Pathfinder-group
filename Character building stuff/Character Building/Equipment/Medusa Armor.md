# Medusa Armor
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-cursed-items-medusa-armor.webp|150]]

This _+2 adamantine scale mail_ appears to have a _fortification_ rune but grants none of its effects. Whenever you are critically hit, after taking damage, you become petrified for 1 round. Once the curse has activated for the first time, the armor fuses to you.
