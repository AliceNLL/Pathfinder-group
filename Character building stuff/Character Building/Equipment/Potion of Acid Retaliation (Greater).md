# Potion of Acid Retaliation (Greater)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-consumables-potions-potion-of-acid-retalliation.webp|150]]

**Activate** 1 Interact

For 1 minute after drinking a potion of acid retaliation, you glow with a faint aura of acid energy, and a creature that touches you (such as by making an unarmed attack or using a spell with a range of touch against you) or is adjacent to you and hits you with a melee weapon strike takes acid damage.

The aura deals 3d6 acid damage.
