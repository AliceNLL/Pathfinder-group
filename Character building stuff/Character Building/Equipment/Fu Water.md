# Fu Water
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-consumables-potions-fu-water.webp|150]]

Burnt fulu ashes float in this liquid, lending a distinctive red color and imparting it with a variety of purifying effects. Unlike many fulu items, fu water must be created using divine magic.

**Effect** This potion functions as a bottle of holy water. Like holy water, you throw it as a Strike. It's a simple thrown weapon with a range increment of 20 feet. Unlike an alchemical bomb, it doesn't add the manipulate trait to the attack made with it.

**Activate** 1 Interact

**Effect** You drink the fu water to counteract ailments within yourself. Attempt a counteract check with a +9 counteract modifier and a counteract level of 3 against one effect that imposes the [[Confused]], [[Fascinated]], [[Frightened]], or [[Stupefied]] condition. You are then [[Sickened 1]].
