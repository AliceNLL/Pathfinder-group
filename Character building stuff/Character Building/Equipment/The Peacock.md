# The Peacock
![[icons-sundries-gaming-playing-cards-grey.webp|150]]

**Suit** Keys (Dex)

**Alignment** neutral

* * *

_The Peacock_ represents a sudden shift in attitude or societal change, often represented by a colorful but ugly creature that serves as a reminder as to what happens if something beautiful refuses to change with the times. As long as you have _The Peacock_ invested, you can react to sudden changes more swiftly, and gain [[Incredible Initiative]] as a bonus feat. If you already possess this feat, you gain a +2 item bonus on all initiative checks. This item bonus increases to +3 if you are at least 17th level.

**Activate** 2 envision, Interact

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** You freeze your appearance as it exists in this very moment by tapping The Peacock to your lips. You cast _[[Mountain Resilience]]_ on yourself, but with a duration of 30 minutes instead of 20 minutes. The level of the spell is one-half your level rounded down (minimum 6th level).
