# Potion of Undetectability
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-consumables-potions-potion-of-undetectability.webp|150]]

**Activate** A (manipulate)

* * *

Drinking this dull-black liquid makes you undetectable to detection effects.

This grants the same effects as _[[Hidden Mind]]_ but without the bonus against mental effects. You also gain the effects of a 4th-rank _[[Invisibility]]_ spell, which protects against _[[See the Unseen]]_ spells of 8th rank and lower and has a DC of 36 against _[[Truesight]]_.

The potion's effects last for 10 minutes.
