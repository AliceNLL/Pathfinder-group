# Carrion Cask
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-equipment.svg|150]]

This stylized, palm-sized box contains a black, ooze-like substance that can easily devour a corpse in moments, breaking the body down into a necromantic sludge.

**Activate** Interact

**Frequency** once per day

**Effect** You feed a corpse of a Small-sized or larger creature to the cask, little by little. The activation requires a three-action activity for a Small or Medium creature, a 1-minute activity for a Larger creature, and a 10-minute activity for a Huge creature. A Gargantuan creature is too large for the cask to devour.
