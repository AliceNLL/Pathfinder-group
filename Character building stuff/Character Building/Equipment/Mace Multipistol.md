# Mace Multipistol
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-weapons-mace-multipistol.webp|150]]

At first glance this weapon looks like nothing more than an iron-bound club. But the top of the weapon features a latch that opens to reveal three rotating pistol muzzles concealed in the mace's head that can be fired and rotated using triggers built into the weapon's haft.
