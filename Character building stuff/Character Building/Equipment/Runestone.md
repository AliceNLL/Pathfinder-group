# Runestone
![[icons-commodities-treasure-token-runed-os-grey.webp|150]]

This flat piece of hard stone is specially prepared for etching a magical fundamental rune or property rune. You can etch only one rune upon a stone. When a rune is transferred from the _runestone_ to another object, the _runestone_ cracks and is destroyed. The Price listed is for an empty stone; a stone holding a rune adds the Price of the rune.
