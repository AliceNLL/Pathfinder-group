# Bronze Dragon's Breath Potion (Wyrm)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-consumables-potions-bronze-dragons-breath-potion.webp|150]]

This liquid contains blood from a bronze dragon. For 1 hour after you imbibe the concoction, you can unleash a bronze dragon's breath weapon. The potency of the breath depends on the potion's type, based on the age of the dragon whose blood was used to make the potion.

Exhaling dragon breath uses a single action. You create a 30 foot line of electricity which deals 10d6 electricity damage. All creatures in the area must attempt a DC 37 reflex save.

After you use the breath weapon, you can't do so again for 1d4 rounds.
