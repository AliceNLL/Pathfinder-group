# Bellflower Toolbelt
![[icons-equipment-waist-belt-coiled-leather-steel.webp|150]]

Different versions of the bellflower toolbelt are customized to appear to suit specific trades, so a belt used for carpentry would look different from a belt for baking.

**Activate**2 envision, Interact

* * *

**Effect** You place an object of up to 1 Bulk into the belt, transforming that object into a tool befitting the trade for which the belt was created. Each object remains transformed until it has been removed from the belt for 24 hours or someone uses a single Interact action to return it to its normal form. If enough transformed items are in it, the belt can be used as a [[Artisan's Toolkit]] for that trade.
