# Spellguard Blade
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-weapons-specific-magic-weapons-spellguard-blade.webp|150]]

The guard of this +1 striking main-gauche is inscribed with eldritch glyphs that guard against magic.

When you are benefiting from the +1 circumstance bonus to AC from this weapon's parry trait, you also apply that circumstance bonus to your saving throws against spells that target you.
