An _exploration lens_ is a magical glass lens designed for a [[Lantern (Bull's Eye)|Bull's Eye Lantern]]. When light from the lantern passes through the lens, it alters the light to make it easier to perform a common exploration activity with the lantern.

Alternatively, an _exploration lens_ can be installed in a [[Wayfinder]] like an aeon stone. In this case, light (such as that from a [[Lantern (Hooded)]], [[Torch]], or _[[Light]]_ spell) must still pass through the lens and you must hold the wayfinder in your hand for it to function.

There are several different types of _exploration lens_, each granting benefits with a different type of exploration activity. Each type of lens is distinguishable from all the other types by holding it up to a bright light.

**Type: Searching**

This lens has an opalescent sheen when held up to light.

The lens subtly outlines hidden doors and concealed hazards, granting you a +2 item bonus to Perception checks to spot such features while [[Search|Searching]].

Even if you aren't Searching, you get a check to find traps that normally require you to Search.
