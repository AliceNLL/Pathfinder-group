# Rhythm Bone (Greater)
![[icons-commodities-bones-bone-jaw-teeth-brown.webp|150]]

This small, enchanted bone (most often a jaw) is usually capped with metal at its ends. It's activated by striking it against a hard surface.

* * *

**Activate** 1 Interact

**Effect** The bone begins recording the next 10 minutes of ambient sounds (including speech) that require a DC 20 or lower Perception check to hear. The bone's recording doesn't copy magical auditory effects, such as those of spellcasting, a harpy's song, or a banshee's wail. Once the rhythm bone has been activated in this way, it retains the recorded sound for the rest of its existence and can't be activated this way again.

* * *

**Activate** 1 Interact

**Effect** The bone replays its recorded sounds.

**Craft Requirements** Supply a casting of _[[Ghost Sound]]_.
