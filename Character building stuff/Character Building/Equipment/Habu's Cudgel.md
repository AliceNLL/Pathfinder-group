# Habu's Cudgel
![[icons-weapons-clubs-club-barbed.webp|150]]

Long associated with a notorious crime boss in Nantambu, this stout _+1 striking fearsome club_ is studded with vicious-looking knobs of obsidian and wrapped in cloth for a better grip. It emits a ghastly groan when swung.

* * *

**Activate** 2 Interact

**Frequency** once per day

**Effect** You gesture at a square within 40 feet with _Habu's Cudgel_. The club causes a frightful wail to unleash from that square and casts _[[Fear]]_ (DC 24 will) targeting the creature in that square and all adjacent creatures.
