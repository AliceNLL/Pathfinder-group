# Marvelous Calliope
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-structures-marvelous-calliope.webp|150]]

This large slide whistle appears to be made of fine brass, the sides of which are engraved with musical notes and dancing clowns.

* * *

**Activate** 1 minute (command, envision, Interact)

**Effect** You blow a tune upon the slide whistle, causing the whistle to expand. The whistle sprouts from one into several, and then creates a large wooden frame and keyboard. By the time the unfolding is complete, the whistle fully transforms into a calliope, a wagon-sized contraption consisting of several steam whistles played like an organ. The calliope is heavy and anchored in place.

You have a +1 item bonus to Performance checks to play the calliope. The calliope has a tendency to produce music for a few seconds after you cease playing it, adding a jaunty and overlong conclusion to your music.

If you use an Interact action to pull the small metal ring on the underside of the _marvelous calliope_, the calliope collapses back down into a slide whistle.

* * *

**Activate** D Interact

**Frequency** once per hour

**Effect** You play the calliope, causing it to cast _[[Charm]]_ on one of the listeners.
