# Ochre Fulcrum Lens
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-other-ochre-fulcrum-lenses.webp|150]]

This brownish-orange lens always seems dusty and gritty, even when wet. While you have the Ochre Fulcrum Lens invested, lassitude grips you. You gain resistance 10 to mental damage and a +2 status bonus to saves against emotion effects. You can also activate the lens in the following ways.

* * *

**Activate** 2 Interact

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** You hold up the Ochre Fulcrum Lens in your hand and the item casts _[[Wave of Despair]]_ (DC 31 will save).

* * *

**Activate** 2 Interact (attack, possession)

While grasping the lens, make a melee spell attack roll with a modifier of +21. On a hit, you force the splinter of Nhimbaloth's essence from the lens to possess the target. You're no longer invested in the lens, and the target gains the benefits as though it had invested the lens but can't activate the lens's other abilities. This effect is permanent, but it can be ended by any effect that removes a possession effect. The lens doesn't have any magical abilities until the possession effect ends; when it does, the essence returns to the lens.
