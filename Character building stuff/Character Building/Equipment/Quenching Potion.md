# Quenching Potion
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-consumable.svg|150]]

**Activate** 1 Interact

Quenching potion is a clear liquid that tastes like fresh, cool spring water. Drinking this potion or pouring it over yourself completely hydrates you and cleanses your system. Immediately attempt a flat check to end any persistent acid, fire, poison, or void damage affecting you, and attempt a new saving throw against any poison affecting you. Poison can't progress to a worse stage due to this saving throw. The potion counts as a particularly appropriate type of help against persistent acid, fire, poison, and void damage.
