# Skinsaw Mask
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-worn-items-other-worn-items-skinsaw-mask.webp|150]]

A patchwork of humanoid flesh makes up a _skinsaw mask_, which is stitched together with black silk or wire. It is distinctive for its bulbous orange eye- crafted from a magical glass bauble-and wide row of teeth. When worn, the mask amplifies your ability to sense fear in other creatures. You know the value of the [[Frightened]] condition of any [[Observed]] creature, and you gain a +1 item bonus to Perception checks to [[Seek]] frightened creatures. Whenever you deal precision damage to a frightened creature, you deal 1 additional precision damage. If you are not evil, you are [[Drained 1|Drained 2]] while wearing the _s__kinsaw mask_.
