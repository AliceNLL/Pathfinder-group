![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-weapons-specific-magic-weapons-final-rest.webp|150]]

This _+3 [[Disrupting (Greater)]] greater striking silver longsword_ is made from the purest silver. The blade is carefully etched to depict a vast and sprawling necropolis, a place where the dead are laid to rest. Whenever you critically hit an undead creature with _final rest_, the undead creature takes 3d6 persistent,spirit damage, with a DC 36 fortitude.

**Critical Success** No effect.

**Success** The creature takes half the persistent spirit damage.

**Failure** The creature is [[Stunned 1]] and takes the full persistent spirit damage.

**Critical Failure** The creature is [[Stunned 1|Stunned]] and takes double the persistent spirit damage.
