This frothing fluid causes the drinker's body to exude trace odor absorbing oils. For 8 hours after drinking this elixir, your scent is nearly unnoticeable.

Creatures with imprecise scent don't detect you with that sense unless they [[Seek]] for you, and you are concealed from creatures that perceive you with precise scent. You gain a +4 item bonus against attempts to Seek you by creatures using only scent-based senses; if they use any other senses as well, the bonus doesn't apply.
