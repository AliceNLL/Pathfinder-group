# Living Leaf Weave
![[icons-equipment-chest-breastplate-collared-steel-green.webp|150]]

**Activate** 1 Interact

This suit of leaf weave armor is specially modified to metabolize the alchemical accelerants in medicinal compounds. A special receptacle in the armor can hold an elixir of life, which takes 3 Interact actions to install. A loaded suit of living leaf weave can be activated to grow slithering vines from the armor, granting an item bonus to Athletics checks to [[Grapple]], to your Fortitude DC to resist Grapple, [[Disarm]], or [[Shove]] attempts, and to your Reflex DCs to resist [[Trip]] attempts. The effects last for 3 rounds, consuming the elixir of life, and once the reaction has begun it can't be deactivated.
