# Sapling Shield (True)
![[icons-equipment-shield-buckler-wooden-boss-brown.webp|150]]

This surprisingly weighty, though well-balanced, wooden buckler (Hardness 15, HP 120, and BT 60) is emblazoned with the image of a sapling. The sapling withers as the shield takes damage.

**Activate** 1 envision

* * *

**Effect** The buckler expands, with the sapling image growing into a mighty oak tree. The buckler becomes a tower shield, gaining the corresponding AC bonus, Speed penalty, and ability to [[Take Cover]]. It keeps the same Hit Points and Broken Threshold, but its Hardness and Bulk increase by 2 in this form. The shield remains in this form until you Activate it again to revert it to a buckler.
