# Sairazul Blue
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-consumable.svg|150]]

**Activate** 1 (manipulate)

* * *

A _Sairazul blue_ potion is a rich navy blue in color. Subjects of the Crystalline Queen produced the potion to protect themselves from the radiation Ayrzul left behind. For the next 8 hours, your skin becomes navy blue, and you gain resistance 5 to poison damage and void damage.

If you drop to 0 Hit Points due to poison or void damage, the _Sairazul blue_ within your body reacts, healing you for `dice: 8d8` Hit Points. The resistances the potion grants then end.
