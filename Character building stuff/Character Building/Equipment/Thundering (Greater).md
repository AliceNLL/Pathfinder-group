# Thundering (Greater)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-runes-weapon-property-runes-weapon-property-runes.webp|150]]

A _thundering_ weapon lets out a peal of thunder when it hits, dealing an extra 1d6 sonic damage on a successful Strike. On a critical hit, the target must succeed at a DC 34 fortitude save or be [[Deafened]] permanently.

Sonic damage dealt by this weapon ignores the target's sonic resistance.
