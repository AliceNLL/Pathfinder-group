# The Queen Mother
![[icons-sundries-gaming-playing-cards-grey.webp|150]]

**Suit** Stars (Wis)

**Alignment** lawful neutral

* * *

_The Queen Mother_ is knowledge manifest, but she only shares this knowledge with loyal subjects. When you first invest _The Queen Mother_, choose a Lore skill in which you have no proficiency. As long as you continue to have the Queen Mother invested, you treat that Lore skill as if your proficiency rank with it were a master. If you're at least 15th level, you treat that Lore skill as if you were legendary with it instead. You can change your selected Lore once per day as part of your daily preparations, as long as you have _The Queen Mother_ invested.

**Activate** 3 command, envision, Interact

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** You call upon a loyal subject to aid you by holding The Queen Mother out and asking her to send help. You cast _[[Summon Animal]]_ or _[[Summon Construct]]_, but with a range of 90 feet. The level of the spell is one-half your level rounded down.
