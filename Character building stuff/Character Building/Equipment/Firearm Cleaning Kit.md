# Firearm Cleaning Kit
![[icons-containers-bags-pack-leather-gold-pink.webp|150]]

This kit contains cleaning cloth, oil, small steel brushes, and other minor tools necessary for proper cleaning and maintenance of a firearm. Without a firearm cleaning kit, you can't perform the necessary tasks during your daily preparations to ensure that your firearm isn't at risk of misfiring under normal use conditions.
