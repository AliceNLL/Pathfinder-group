# Flare Snare
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-snares-flare-snare.webp|150]]

Using bioluminescent matter or alchemical reagents, you rig a short-lived flare to a trip wire or pressure plate. When a Small or larger creature enters the square, this flare shoots into the sky. To creatures with a clear view of the sky, this flare is visible from up to 2 miles away on a clear day or up to 5 miles away on a clear night.
