# Temple Sword
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-weapons-temple-sword.webp|150]]

This heavy blade is favored by guardians of religious sites. It has a distinctive, crescent-shaped blade that seems to be a mix of a sickle and sword. It often has holes drilled into the blade or the pommel so that bells or other holy trinkets can be affixed to the weapon.
