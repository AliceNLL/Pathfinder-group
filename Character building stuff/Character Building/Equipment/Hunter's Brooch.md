# Hunter's Brooch
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-worn-items-other-worn-items-hunterss-brooch.webp|150]]

While wearing this silver religious symbol of Erastil, you can cast the _[[Vitality Lash]]_ cantrip as an innate divine spell.

* * *

**Activate** 3 command, Interact

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** By touching a weapon you wield to the symbol and uttering a plea for Erastil's steadying hand, you grant that weapon the deadly d12 trait. Against undead, the weapon instead gains the fatal d12 trait. This blessing lasts for 1 minute, until you score a critical hit with the weapon, or until you aren't wielding the weapon.
