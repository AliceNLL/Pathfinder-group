# Fortification
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-runes-armor-property-runes-armor-property-runes.webp|150]]

A _fortification_ rune wards against the most deadly attacks. Each time you're critically hit while wearing the etched armor, attempt a DC 17 flat. On a success, it becomes a normal hit. This property thickens the armor, increasing its Bulk by 1 and the Strength required to reduce its penalties by 1.
