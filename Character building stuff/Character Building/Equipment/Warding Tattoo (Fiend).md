# Warding Tattoo (Fiend)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-tattoos-warding-tattoo.webp|150]]

Many cultures of Golarion have a tattoo to turn away harm; as such, warding tattoos often resemble whichever dangers are most common to the culture, such as a wild beast or a whirlpool in the high seas of the Shackles. You gain resistance 2 to spells cast by fiends and magical attacks by fiends.

* * *

**Activate** r envision

**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** An enemy, hazard, or the environment makes an attack against your AC, requires you to attempt a saving throw, or causes you to take damage automatically

* * *

**Effect** Until the end of the current turn, against the triggering effect, you gain a +1 status bonus to AC and saving throws and gain resistance 2 to damage. Your resistance to damage from fiends and magical attacks by fiends becomes resistance 5.
