**Activate** 1 Interact

For 10 minutes you gain greatly increased blood production, filtering out contagions and boosting your endurance but causing your body to bloat with blood.

**Benefit** You gain a +2 item bonus to Fortitude and Reflex saves. This bonus improves to +3 when you attempt a save against an effect that has the disease trait, poison trait, or would give you the [[Fatigued]] condition.

**Drawback** Whenever you take piercing or slashing damage, you take 1d6 bleed.
