# Crimson Brand
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-weapons-specific-magic-weapons-crimson-brand.webp|150]]

These ominous swords are decorated with crimson lacquer and serve as perfect conduits for the Crimson Oath's power. The first was granted to Clarethe Iomedar by a mysterious patron who many Reclaimers believe to be an emissary of Ragathiel.

A crimson brand is a +1 striking [[Wounding]] bastard sword. When the wielder uses the crimson brand to cast _[[Invoke the Crimson Oath]]_, they can generate a 60 foot line or a 30 foot cone instead of the normal 20 foot cone.

Whenever the wielder would inflict persistent bleed damage on an undead creature with the _crimson brand_, they can instead wreathe the creature in ruby energy, inflicting the same amount of persistent vitality damage instead of persistent bleed damage.
