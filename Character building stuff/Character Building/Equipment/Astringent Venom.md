# Astringent Venom
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-consumable.svg|150]]

**Activate** 3 Interact

This oily, dark-purple powder gives off the distinct odor of boiled leather. When delivered, the poison acts quickly to constrict the victim's blood flow to their extremities and turn their lungs into a soft jelly. A victim of astringent venom is recognizable by the frostbite-like hue of their hands as they loose circulation to their extremities, making it difficult for them to hold things. Each round at the beginning of their turn, a creature affected by astringent venom must succeed at a DC 5 flat or drop one random item they're holding.

**Saving Throw** DC 32 fortitude

**Onset** 1 round

**Maximum Duration** 6 rounds

**Stage 1** 6d6 poison (1 round)

**Stage 2** 8d6 poison (1 round)

**Stage 3** 10d6 poison and [[Confused]] (1 round)
