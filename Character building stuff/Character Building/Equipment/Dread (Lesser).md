# Dread (Lesser)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-runes-armor-property-runes-armor-property-runes.webp|150]]

Eerie symbols cover your armor, inspiring terror in your foes. Frightened enemies within 30 feet that can see you must attempt a DC 20 will save at the end of their turn; on a failure, the value of their [[Frightened]] condition doesn't decrease below 1 that turn.
