# Repeating Hand Crossbow
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-weapons-repeating-hand-crossbow.webp|150]]

This handheld crossbow features an ingeniously designed catch mechanism at the top of the flight groove, just in front of the latch, which automatically loads a bolt from a magazine and resets the string each time the weapon is fired. A typical repeating hand crossbow magazine holds five bolts.
