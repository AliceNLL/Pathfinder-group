# Icicle
![[icons-magic-water-projectile-arrow-ice-gray-blue.webp|150]]

This _+2 greater striking greater frost longspear_ appears to be a single continuous icicle stretching over 6 feet long. The icicle automatically extinguishes non-magical fires in a 20 foot emanation. While wielding it, you gain fire resistance 5.

**Activate—Quench Flames 2** (concentrate, manipulate)

**Effect** You swing the icicle into the area of an ongoing magical fire, and the spear attempts to counteract the fire with a counteract modifier of +27. If it fails, it can't attempt to counteract the same fire again.

* * *

**Activate—Ice Spike 2** (concentrate, manipulate)

**Frequency** once per day

**Effect** The icicle grows rapidly, piercing creatures in a 30 foot line. Each creature in the area takes 11d6 cold damage with a DC 35 reflex. A creature that fails its save also takes 3d6 persistent,bleed damage (double on a critical failure).
