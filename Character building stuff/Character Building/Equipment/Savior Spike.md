**Activate** F (concentrate)

**Trigger** You attempt to Grab an Edge but haven't rolled

This pyramid-shaped spike is attached to an armor's chest piece. When you activate the spike, it shoots a strand of force to help you gain purchase, giving you a +1 item bonus to the check. If you roll a success on the triggering attempt, you get a critical success instead. If you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead.
