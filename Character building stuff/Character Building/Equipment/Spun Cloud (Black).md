On the Elemental Plane of Air, small clouds of differing colors can sometimes float separately from other cloud formations. Clever people can spin these clouds into small handfuls, creating a magical bundle of elemental power. Unlike most bottled breath, _spun clouds_ don't have any effect on you while you hold them in your lungs, but you can exhale the cloud as a single action. When exhaled, the cloud flows out and expands into a 20 foot burst within 60 feet of you. The cloud dissipates after 1 minute.

A dark storm cloud conceals creatures within it. Creatures outside the cloud are [[Concealed]] to creatures within it.
