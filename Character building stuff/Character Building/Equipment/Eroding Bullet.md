**Ammunition** round

Eroding bullets cast a faint green glow, and smell like the sickly- sweet organic gases that rise from corpses. Handling an eroding bullet without gloves deals 1 acid damage and leaves the putrid scent coated on your fingers. Upon Striking an enemy, the glass casing inside the bullet bursts, releasing a splattering of bubbling green acid that coats the target. The target takes 2d6 persistent,acid damage in addition to the damage normally dealt by the attack.
