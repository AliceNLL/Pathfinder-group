# Invisible Chain Shirt
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-armor-specific-magic-armor-invisible-chain-shirt.webp|150]]

This _+2 resilient [[Invisibility]] chain shirt_ is itself invisible. Other creatures can't see it at all, allowing you to wear it surreptitiously. Additionally, the armor's invisible composition is quieter and more comfortable than a normal chain shirt. It loses the noisy trait and gains the comfort trait.

**Activate** 2 envision

**Frequency** once per minute

**Effect** You Stride and turn partially invisible, becoming [[Concealed]] until the end of your next turn or until you use a hostile action, whichever comes first. As normal, you can use the concealment from this activation to [[Hide]].
