# Aromatic Ammunition
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-consumables-ammunition-aromatic-ammunition.webp|150]]

**Ammunition** any

**Activate** 1 Interact

* * *

The components of this ammunition emit a strong smell when combined during its activation. A creature hit by an activated aromatic ammunition gains a distinct odor for up to 1 hour or until the scent is washed off (requiring at least a gallon of water and 10 minutes of scrubbing). Any creatures within 30 feet smell the target, allowing even those with a weak sense of smell to detect its presence, and all creatures gain a +1 item bonus to Track the affected creature for as long as it has the odor. A creature that has imprecise or precise scent doubles the range at which they can detect the target using their scent compared to the normal range of their scent.
