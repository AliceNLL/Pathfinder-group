This tattoo takes the shape of a muscular orc, with molten flesh and hollow eye sockets that seep smoke. You don't take damage from extreme heat or severe heat. While exposed to incredible heat, you take only minor heat damage every hour, instead of moderate heat damage every minute. You can see through ash and smoke.

**Effect** You stomp on the ground, causing a 5 foot burst{5-foot radius}, 30- foot tall cylinder of lava to erupt from the ground within a range of 60 feet. You can choose to increase the radius of the cylinder to 10 foot burst{10 feet}. Similarly, the height of the cylinder increases to 60 feet. The cylinder deals 12d6 fire damage. All creatures in the area must attempt a DC 34 Basic reflex save.
