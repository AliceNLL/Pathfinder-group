# Donchak
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-weapon.svg|150]]

This long metal pole has a large chakram attached at the end. A mechanism within the handle allows the wielder to launch and retract the chakram, which is connected with wire to the inside of the weapon. The donchak is seldom seen used outside training scenarios.
