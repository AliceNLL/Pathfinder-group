# Passage Pane
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-treasure-art-objects-greater-art-object-platinum-framed-monocle.webp|150]]

The pane of this large circular mirror has a diameter of 8 feet and a gray cast. The mirror reflects its surroundings in muted colors, and any living creatures that look into the mirror see themselves as preserved corpses with sallow skin, sunken cheeks, and a vacant expression. The mirror is mounted in a bone frame intricately carved with imagery of corvids, keys, and winding roads. These roads represent the Dead Roads, the secret back routes between the Boneyard and all other planes that are under the purview of the psychopomp usher Barzahk the Passage and their followers.

_Passage panes_ are created by incredibly powerful priests of Barzahk using mirrors that have reflected Barzahk during their travels from when Barzahk passes through mortal realms. Through prayer, powerful magic, and exceptional crafting skill, these mirrors form a spiritual connection to the Dead Roads, which can be harnessed to open a gate to the Boneyard.

To utilize a _passage pane_, the mirror must be securely mounted on a solid surface. Once mounted, a user must bond with the _passage pane_ by gazing beyond their dead visage into the Dead Roads. Bonding takes patience and can only be accomplished by a living creature who has at least master proficiency in Religion and who succeeds at a DC 40 religion check. Attempting to bond with the mirror in this way takes 1 hour. Once a creature is bonded with the mirror, they can use the _passage pane_ to open a portal to a random point along the Dead Roads. A creature with knowledge of a location in the Boneyard can force the mirror to lock onto that location, allowing more pointed travel. Only one creature can be bonded with the mirror at a time. When a creature forms a bond with the mirror, any previous bonds are immediately severed. Undead can't bond with the _passage pane_.

When Barzahk themself walks the Dead Roads, a depiction of them appears in the frame's carvings. When Barzahk is depicted in this way, they can prevent the _passage pane_ from Activating or alter the destination of the _passage pane_, if desired.

**Activate** 1 minute (envision, Interact; divination, divine, scrying)

**Requirements** The _passage pane_ is mounted firmly to a solid surface, and you're bonded with the _passage pane_

* * *

**Effect** You focus on a location in the Boneyard that you wish to travel to. You must have either seen or visited this location before or be able to describe the location in detail and its purpose or name, as appropriate. Attempt a DC 40 religion check. On a success, the mirror locks onto your desired location, and you (and only you) see this location reflected in the mirror's pane.

**Activate** 3 envision, Interact (conjuration, divine, teleportation)

**Frequency** once per week

**Requirements** The _passage pane_ is mounted firmly to a solid surface, and you're bonded with the _passage pane_

* * *

**Effect** You urge the mirror to open a rift to the Boneyard. Creatures can travel through this rift in either direction. If you've successfully forced the mirror to lock onto a specific location, the mirror's pane becomes a rift to the Boneyard that opens onto that location. If you haven't forced the mirror to lock onto a specific location, the mirror's pane becomes a rift to a random location on the Dead Roads. This rift remains open until you close it, up to a maximum of 24 hours. As long as the rift is open, the mirror is immovable, no one can form a bond with the mirror, and no one but you can Activate the mirror.

**Activate** 3 envision, Interact (conjuration, divine, teleportation)

**Requirements** The _passage pane_ is an active rift to the Boneyard, and you're bonded with the _passage pane_

* * *

**Effect** You close the rift.

* * *

**Destruction** The _passage pane_ shatters into thousands of pieces if Barzahk the Passage bonds with the mirror and wills its destruction.
