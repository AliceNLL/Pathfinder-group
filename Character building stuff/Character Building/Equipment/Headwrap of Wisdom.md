![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-worn-items-apex-items-headband-of-inspired-wisdom.webp|150]]

This simple scarf is designed for wrapping around the head and comes with a gemmed pin for decoration. When you invest the headwrap, you either increase your Wisdom modifier by 1 or increase it to +4, whichever would give you a higher value.

**Frequency** once per day

**Effect** When you are considering a course of action, you get a gut feeling about whether it's a good idea. You gain the effects of an _[[Augury]]_ spell, except that you receive the result from your own instincts rather than an external source.

**Activate—Reclaim Your Mind R**(concentrate, fortune)

**Frequency** once per hour

**Trigger** You fail a saving throw against an effect that makes you [[Confused]], [[Fascinated]], or [[Stupefied]]
