# Ghost Delivery Fulu
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-consumables-fulus-fulu-modest.webp|150]]

**Duration** 1 week

A ghost delivery fulu's inscription resembles a dovecote with spirits around it, and it has a prominent stamp in red wax. This fulu activates once affixed, becoming the homing location of ghost courier fulus with a matching stamp. Delivered ghost courier fulu messages stick to the ghost delivery fulu but can be easily removed.
