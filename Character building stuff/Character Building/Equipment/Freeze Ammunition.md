# Freeze Ammunition
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-consumable.svg|150]]

**Ammunition** any

**Activate** 1 Interact

* * *

Freeze ammunition carries chilling reagents that activate on contact with the target. A creature hit by activated freeze ammunition takes cold damage instead of the weapon's normal damage type, plus 2 splash damage. Hitting a 5-foot-square surface successfully with freeze ammunition deals 2 cold splash damage and covers the space in a layer of ice. Each creature standing on the icy surface must succeed at a DC 20 reflex check or else fall [[Prone]]. Creatures using an action to move onto the icy surface must attempt either a Reflex save or an Acrobatics check to [[Balance]]. Creatures that Step or [[Crawl]] don't need to attempt a check or save. The ice melts after 1 minute, although unusually hot or cold temperatures can change this duration at the GM's discretion. Dealing at least 1 point of fire damage to the ice removes it instantly
