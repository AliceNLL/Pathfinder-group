# Concealed Holster
![[icons-equipment-waist-belt-coiled-leather-steel.webp|150]]

This leather holster is crafted to better hide small firearms from view. Only firearms designed for use in one hand are small enough to disguise with this holster. You gain a +1 item bonus to Stealth checks and DCs to hide or conceal a firearm or hand crossbow in this holster.
