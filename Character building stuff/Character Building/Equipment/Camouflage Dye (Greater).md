# Camouflage Dye (Greater)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-consumable.svg|150]]

**Activate** 1 Interact

Camouflage dye uses a variety of alchemically treated paints and crushed crystals to make the user particularly hard to distinguish from their surroundings. When you Activate the dye by sprinkling it on yourself or a creature within reach, the target and its clothing change colors, blending into their surroundings until the target makes a sudden movement. The target can [[Hide]] or [[Sneak]] without cover or concealment for 1 minute.
