# Mirror-Ball Snare
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-snares-mirror-ball-snare.webp|150]]

A mixture of metal shavings and flash powder inside this small, mirrored sphere ignites when disturbed, causing the ball to flash and spin. When a creature enters the square, the ball pops into the air, and all creatures within 10 feet who can see the mirror ball must succeed at a DC 22 fortitude save or become [[Dazzled]] for 1 round. On a critical failure, affected creatures are instead dazzled for 1 minute.
