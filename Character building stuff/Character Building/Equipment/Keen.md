# Keen
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-runes-weapon-property-runes-weapon-property-runes.webp|150]]

The edges of a _keen_ weapon are preternaturally sharp. Attacks with this weapon are a critical hit on a 19 on the die as long as that result is a success. This property has no effect on a 19 if the result would be a failure.
