# Black Tendril Shot (Greater)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-consumable.svg|150]]

**Ammunition** any

**Activate** 1 command

* * *

A glistening, tar-like substance that's displeasing to the touch coats a black tendril shot. When the activated ammunition hits a target, it exudes tendrils that encase the target, which must attempt a DC 39 fortitude saving throw. The ammunition's effects last until the target Escapes.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target is [[Slowed]] but gains a +2 circumstance bonus to [[Escape]] the ammunition's effect.

**Failure** The target is slowed 1.

**Critical Failure** The target is [[Slowed|Slowed 2]].
