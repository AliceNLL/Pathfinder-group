# Wayfinder

**Access** member of the Pathfinder Society

This compact compass repurposes ancient technology to draw fantastic powers from the mysterious magical items called _aeon stones_. It serves as a badge of office for agents of the Pathfinder Society and as a status symbol among adventurers of any stripe. A _wayfinder_ functions as a compass.

An indentation in the middle of the _wayfinder_ can hold a single _aeon stone_. Placing an _aeon stone_ in this indentation provides you all the benefits of having the _aeon stone_ orbiting your head, but it protects the stone from being noticed or stolen as easily. You invest a _wayfinder_ and the _aeon stone_ within it simultaneously, and they count as only one item toward your investiture limit. An invested _aeon stone_ slotted in a _wayfinder_ also grants its resonant power.

If you have more than one _wayfinder_ with an invested _aeon stone_ on your person at a given time, destructive interference from their resonance prevents you from gaining benefits from any of them. You can still benefit from additional _aeon stones_ orbiting your head, just not in _wayfinders_.

**Activateâ€”Light** A (concentrate)

**Effect** The _wayfinder_ is targeted by a 1st-rank _[[Light]]_ spell.
