This light barding is covered in wavelike patterns. The barding adjusts to fit your animal companion regardless of its shape.

**Effect** You trace a finger along the wave patterns on the barding, granting your companion a swim Speed of 30 feet for 10 minutes. If your companion already had a swim Speed, it gains a +10-foot item bonus to its swim Speed for 10 minutes instead. Even if the companion doesn't have the mount special ability, it can still Swim while being ridden.
