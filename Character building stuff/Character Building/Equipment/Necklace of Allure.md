![[icons-equipment-neck-necklace-jeweled-silver-blue.webp|150]]

Several sapphires are set along the length of this brilliant silver necklace. The necklace features an intricately carved pendant in the shape of a wolf's head. You gain a +2 item bonus to Deception and Diplomacy checks. When you invest the necklace, you either increase your Charisma modifier by 1 or increase it to +4, whichever would give you a higher value.
