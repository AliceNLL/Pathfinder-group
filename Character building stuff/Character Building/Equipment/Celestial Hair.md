# Celestial Hair
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-consumables-talismans-celestial-hair.webp|150]]

**Usage** affixed to armor

**Activate** F Interact

**Trigger** You critically fail a saving throw or are critically hit by an attack

This strand of hair shimmers like the strands of fate. When you activate the string, it resonates with a single, perfect note.

The triggering saving throw becomes a failure or the triggering attack roll becomes a regular hit, not critical one. If the source of the attack or effect is an evil creature, that creature must succeed at a DC 41 will saving throw or be [[Enfeebled 1|Enfeebled 2]] and [[Stupefied|Stupefied 2]] until the end of its next turn.
