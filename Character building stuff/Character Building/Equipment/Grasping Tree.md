![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-snares-grasping-tree.webp|150]]

You rig tree branches, thin strands of bark, or other plant matter to close in on a creature that enters the snare's square. The first creature to enter the square must attempt a DC 19 reflex saving throw.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target takes 1d4 slashing damage.

**Failure** As success, plus the target is off-guard.

**Critical Failure** The target takes 2d4 slashing damage and is immobilized until it destroys the snare (AC 16, HP 25) or Escapes (DC 19).
