# Aeon Stone (Gold Nodule)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-worn-items-other-worn-items-aeon-stone-gold-nodule.webp|150]]

When a gold nodule aeon stone is created, its creator chooses a language they know to store within the crystal. When you invest the stone, you gain the ability to understand, speak, and write that language.

The resonant power allows you to cast _[[Translate]]_ as an occult innate spell once per day.
