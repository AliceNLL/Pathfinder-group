# Chain Mail
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-armor-chainmail.webp|150]]

A suit of chain mail consists of several pieces of armor composed of small metal rings linked together in a protective mesh. It typically includes a chain shirt, leggings, a pair of arms, and a coif, collectively protecting most of the body.
