![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-alchemical-items-alchemical-elixirs-serene-mutagen.webp|150]]

**Activate** A Interact

* * *

You gain inner serenity, focused on file details and steeled against mental assaults, but you find violence off-putting.

**Benefit** You gain a +4 item bonus to Will saves and Perception, Medicine, Nature, Religion, and Survival checks. When you roll a success on a Will save against a mental effect, you get a critical success instead, and your critical failures on Will saves against mental effects become failures instead.

**Drawback** You take a -1 penalty to attack rolls and save DCs of offensive spells, and a -1 penalty per damage die to all weapon, unarmed attack, and spell damage.

**Duration** 1 hour.
