# Serpent Oil (Moderate)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-consumable.svg|150]]

**Activate** 1 Interact

This glistening oil has a green hue and tiny snake scales floating within. If you slather serpent oil on an object, the object transforms. The oil can be applied to a Small object, producing a [[Sea-Snake]], or a Medium object, producing a [[Ball-Python]], keeping some of the same colors and patterns of the original item. If placed on other objects, the oil fails and is wasted. This false snake has the minion trait. It remains in snake form for 1 minute before returning to its object state. If slain, the item returns to its original form, unharmed.
