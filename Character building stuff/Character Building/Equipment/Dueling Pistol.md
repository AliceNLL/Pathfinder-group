# Dueling Pistol
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-weapons-dueling-pistol.webp|150]]

Made for settling disputes when diplomacy fails, dueling pistols are finely crafted and made to fit easily into a holster or pocket. Noble and wealthy merchants in both Alkenstar and Dongun Hold often own matching pairs of dueling pistols in case they're called upon to address a challenge-though this practice has become increasingly rare in the modern age.
