# Blink Blade
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-weapons-dagger.webp|150]]

The blade of this _+2 striking dagger_ is etched with whirling portals, and a single blue sapphire adorns its hilt. It feels lightweight and is always slightly warm to the touch.

**Activate** 2 Interact

**Frequency** once per day

**Effect** You cast _[[Translocate]]_. The space you leave and the one you appear in are filled with puffs of smoke that make anyone within [[Concealed]] until they leave the smoke or until the end of your next turn, at which point the smoke dissipates. When used in strong winds, the smoke disperses immediately.
