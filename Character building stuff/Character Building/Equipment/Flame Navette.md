![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-consumables-talismans-flame-navette.webp|150]]

**Usage** affixed to armor

**Activate** A Envision

**Requirements** You're an Expert in Will saves

This piece of bronzite is shaped like an oval with points at both ends. It has a carved flame at its center and is traditionally worn over the heart. You can activate only one _flame navette_ per day.

When you activate the navette, you gain the benefit of the fighter's [[Determination]] class feat, with a counteract modifier of +22. If you have the Determination feat, you can use your own modifier if it's better.
