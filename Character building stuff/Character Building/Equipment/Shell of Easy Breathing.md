# Shell of Easy Breathing
![[icons-commodities-biological-shell-gold.webp|150]]

This large salt-encrusted seashell is more than 2 feet across, with images of deep sea creatures carved around its edge.

**Activateâ€”Fill the Shell** 1 (manipulate)

**Effect** You place the shell on a level surface and sprinkle a few drops of water into its basin. The shell slowly fills with saltwater over the course of 1 minute. The shell's magic then becomes active, indicated by a steady stream of bubbles. Moving the shell disturbs its contents, causing the item to deactivate and the water inside to evaporate; otherwise, it remains activated for an unlimited duration. While the shell is activated, a creature can submerge its head and let water and bubbles fill its nose and mouth (or whatever body part it uses for breathing) as a 3-action activity. For the next hour, the creature can breathe underwater. The creature is then temporarily immune to _shells of easy breathing_ until the next time it makes its daily preparations.
