# Boarding Pike
![[icons-weapons-polearms-spear-hooked-spike.webp|150]]

Taking the form of a longspear fitted with crossbars or hooks, a boarding pike provides its wielder a sharp implement that's as adept at shoving enemies off a ship's railings as facilitating the boarding of other vessels. This is a martial melee weapon.
