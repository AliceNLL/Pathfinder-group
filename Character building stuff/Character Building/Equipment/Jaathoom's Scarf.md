# Jaathoom's Scarf
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-equipment.svg|150]]

This scarf is made of fine silk that's the same shade of blue as a clear, cloudless sky. The short ends are edged with a fine gold fringe that seems to sway even in still weather as though touched by invisible winds. The long edges have exquisite embroidery in threads that vary from a blue identical to the silk to the deep gray of storm clouds during winter. Wearing this scarf grants a +2 item bonus to Performance checks to dance and to Acrobatics checks to [[Escape]].

**Activate—Vanish** 2 (concentrate)

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** The scarf casts 4th-rank _[[Invisibility]]_ on you.

**Activate—Jaathoom's Rebuke** 1 (concentrate)

**Frequency** once per hour

* * *

**Effect** You let the winds around you catch the edges of the _jaathoom's scarf,_ and a jaathoom shuyookh appears with a sudden updraft. The winds force your enemies back, granting you some breathing room in battle. Each enemy in a 10 foot emanation must succeed at a DC 18 fortitude save or be pushed 10 feet. A creature that critically fails is also knocked [[Prone]] after being moved. Creatures with the air trait are immune to all these effects.
