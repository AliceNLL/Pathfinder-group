# Fake Blood Pack
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-worn-items-other-worn-items-fake-blood-pack.webp|150]]

Adventurers have found a number of uses for these animal blood-filled bladders, which were originally used in theatrical productions. Whenever you take slashing or piercing damage with the fake blood pack under your clothes or armor, roll a DC 11 flat. On a success, the blood pack is punctured. You or an ally can puncture the hidden pack intentionally.

When faking an injury, the blood pack grants a +2 item bonus to relevant Deception checks, such as to [[Lie]] about being injured. Abilities that trigger when a creature deals bleed damage, determine if a creature is bleeding, or are otherwise based on bleed damage don't trigger or apply for blood from a fake blood pack, which might mean creatures with such abilities automatically realize the ruse.
