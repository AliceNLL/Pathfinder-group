**Activate** 1 Strike

* * *

This flask contains a fine red powder made from toxic berries. You gain a +1 item bonus to attack rolls. A moderate vexing vapor bomb deals 2d6 mental damage and 2 mental splash damage. On a hit, the target must succeed at a DC 5 flat check before taking actions with the concentrate trait. This lasts until the end of its next turn (1 minute on a critical hit).
