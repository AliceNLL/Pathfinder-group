![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-worn-items-other-worn-items-vaultbreakers-harness.webp|150]]

A _vaultbreaker's harness_ has four pockets across the chest. The pockets contain a set of [[Thieves' Toolkit (Infiltrator)|Thieves' Tools (Infiltrator)]],[[Thieves' Toolkit (Infiltrator Picks)|Thieves' Tools (Infiltrator Picks)]], a [[Crowbar (Levered)]], and a [[Glass Cutter]]. These items are magically bound to the harness; if they are more than 1 foot away from you, they disappear, then reappear in the harness at the next sunset. Broken or destroyed items similarly reappear, restored, in their proper pockets at sunset.
