# Bonmuan Swapping Stone (Moderate)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-consumable.svg|150]]

**Activate** 1 Interact

This small, opalescent stone glows with a light that constantly shifts between colors. When you activate the stone, you throw it into a space within 100 feet. The stone then casts dimension door on you and transports you to itself. This destroys the stone.

You can instead hurl the stone at a creature in an attempt to bring that creature closer to you. Make a ranged Strike against a creature using your highest proficiency with a ranged weapon. The swapping stone has a range increment of 15 feet. On a hit, the stone shatters against the creature, casting dimension door on the creature and causing it to instantly teleport to a space adjacent to you. An unwilling creature can resist this teleportation with a successful DC 31 will save.
