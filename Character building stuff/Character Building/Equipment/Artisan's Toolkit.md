# Artisan's Toolkit
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-adventuring-gear-artisan-tools.webp|150]]

You need these tools to create items from raw materials with the Craft skill. Different sets are needed for different work, as determined by the GM; for example, a blacksmith's toolkit differs from a woodworker's toolkit. If you wear your artisan's toolkit, you can draw and replace itas part of the action that uses it.
