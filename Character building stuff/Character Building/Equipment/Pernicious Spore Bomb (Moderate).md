This flask contains fast-growing mold spores, which quickly take root but just as quickly rot away. You gain a +1 item bonus to attack rolls. The bomb deals 2 poison damage, 2d4 persistent,piercing damage, and 2 poison splash damage. Except on a critical failure, the bomb's splash area is coated in vegetation, becoming difficult terrain for 1 round.
