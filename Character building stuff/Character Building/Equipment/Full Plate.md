# Full Plate
![[icons-equipment-chest-breastplate-layered-steel-green.webp|150]]

Plate mail consists of interlocking plates that encase nearly the entire body in a carapace of steel. It is costly and heavy, and the wearer often requires help to don it correctly, but it provides some of the best defense armor can supply. A suit of this armor comes with an undercoat of [[Padded Armor|padded armor]] and a pair of [[Gauntlet|gauntlets]].
