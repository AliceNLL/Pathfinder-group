# Tripline Arrow
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-consumables-ammunition-viper-arrow.webp|150]]

**Ammunition** arrow

* * *

This arrow unspools a line of wire as its flies at its target. The wire animates as it hits a target and attempts to wrap around its legs before vanishing a moment later. If you can apply the bow's critical specialization effect, you can choose to knock the target [[Prone]] instead of pinning the target. If you cannot apply the bow's critical specialization effect, you can instead attempt to use the arrow to [[Trip]] with the Athletics skill as if the bow had the trip weapon trait. The arrow's unwieldy nature halves its weapon's range increment.
