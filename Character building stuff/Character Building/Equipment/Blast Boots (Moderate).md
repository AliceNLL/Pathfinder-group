These sets of rockets come in pairs and strap onto existing footwear (or a creature's feet). Inserting them and aligning them properly takes 1 minute. When you Activate the moderate blast boots to [[High Jump]], you can increase the vertical distance of your High Jump by up to 30 feet. When you Activate them to [[Long Jump]], you can increase the horizontal distance of your Long Jump by up to 45 feet.
