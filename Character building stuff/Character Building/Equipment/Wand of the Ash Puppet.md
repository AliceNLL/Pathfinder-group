# Wand of the Ash Puppet
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-equipment.svg|150]]

This wand is composed of ash that has been compressed, shaped, and sealed with a clear lacquer. When you trace the wand's tip along a solid surface, it leaves a black trail of charcoal. Writing with the wand in this way never damages or wears the wand down.

**Activate** Cast a Spell

**Frequency** once per day, plus overcharge

* * *

**Effect** You cast _[[Disintegrate]]_. If the spell reduces a living creature to fine powder, you animate that creature's ashes into a [[Sulfur-Zombie]] with the same general appearance as the disintegrated creature. You control this sulfur zombie, which gains the minion and summoned traits. You can issue a verbal command to the sulfur zombie as a single action with the auditory and concentrate traits. The sulfur zombie crumbles into inanimate ash when reduced to 0 Hit Points or after 1 minute, whichever comes first.

**Craft Requirements** Supply a casting of _[[Disintegrate]]_.
