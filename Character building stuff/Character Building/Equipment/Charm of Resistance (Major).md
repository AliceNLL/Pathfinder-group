# Charm of Resistance (Major)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-worn-items-other-worn-items-ring-of-energy-resistance.webp|150]]

This charm, normally hung from the belt or worn around the neck, grants you resistance 15 against one type of energy damage: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. Each charm is crafted to protect against a particular type of energy damage, and its design usually embodies the type of energy it protects the wearer from in some way. For instance, a _charm of cold resistance_ could be carved in the shape of a yeti, whereas a _charm of fire resistance_ would be made from volcanic glass.
