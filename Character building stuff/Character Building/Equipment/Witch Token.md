# Witch Token
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-cursed-items-ring-of-truth.webp|150]]

When the _witch token_ is invested by a mortal, all of the mortal's spells, except those cast at the highest level the mortal can cast, count as 1 level higher for the purpose of counteracting other spells and being counteracted. The creature can also Activate the _witch token_ to Cast a Spell once per day. This spell is chosen from one of the uniila's arcane spontaneous spells of level 4 or lower when the uniila creates the token. While a creature has the _witch token_ invested, it treats its saving throws against the uniila's spells as one degree of success worse, and the uniila always knows the distance and direction to the creature. A creature can't have more than one _witch token_ invested, and an uniila can't have more than one _witch token_ in existence. The uniila can destroy their _witch token_ as a free action with the concentrate trait; if the _witch token_ is invested when the uniila does so, the creature that has the _witch token_ invested takes 9d8 mental damage (DC 29 Basic will).
