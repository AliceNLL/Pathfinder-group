# Alkenstar Ice Wine
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-consumables-potions-fu-water.webp|150]]

This bottle of delicately sweet ice wine has the properties of alcohol. Made exclusively from grapes frozen in the Mana Wastes' erratic surge storms, Alkenstar ice wine finds a ready market among Geb, though undead are still immune to the drug's listed effects.

The listed price is for a mediocre vintage, but finer vintages are higher level and commensurately more expensive.
