# Lich Soul Cage
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-held-items-lich-phylactery.webp|150]]

This item is crafted by a spellcaster who wishes to become a lich. When a lich is destroyed, its soul flees to the _soul cage_. The phylactery then rebuilds the lich's undead body over the course of `dice: 1d10` days. Afterward, the lich manifests next to the _soul cage_, fully healed and in a new body (therefore, it lacks any equipment it had on its old body). A lich's _soul cage_ must be destroyed to prevent a lich from returning.

The standard _soul cage_ is a sealed metal box containing strips of parchment inscribed with magical phrases. This box has Hardness 9 and 36 HP, but some liches devise more durable or difficult-to-obtain _soul cages_. A _soul cage_ might also come in the form of a ring, an amulet, or a similar item; the specifics are up to the creator.
