# The Courtesan
![[icons-sundries-gaming-playing-cards-grey.webp|150]]

**Suit** Crowns (Cha)

**Alignment** chaotic neutral

The Courtesan represents political intrigue and social niceties. As long as The Courtesan is invested, you gain a +2 item bonus to Diplomacy checks to [[Make an Impression]]. This increases to a +3 item bonus if you are at least 17th level.

**Activate** 2 envision, Interact

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** You pass the card over your face and become exactly who you need to be; you cast _[[Illusory Disguise]]_. The level of the spell is one-half your level, rounded down (minimum 6th level). You can change your appearance again at any time during the duration by using a three-action activity, which has the concentrate trait. While under these effects, your Deception checks to Impersonate are one degree of success greater when you use them against a creature that is a lower level than yourself.
