# Juggling Club
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-weapons-juggling-club.webp|150]]

A juggling club is lighter than a typical club and balanced to be easily caught and thrown again by a juggler. While a juggling club deals less damage, the extra throwing distance its light weight allows is important for juggling.
