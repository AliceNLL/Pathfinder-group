Rusting ammunition is made using a rust monster's saliva and, when activated, deals damage to objects or creatures primarily made of metal. The target takes 3d8 persistent,force damage for up to 5 rounds. A creature that drops to 0 Hit Points while taking this persistent damage crumbles into fine powder; its gear remains. For an object, the ammunition destroys a 5-foot cube.
