# Saboteur's Friend
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-consumable.svg|150]]

**Activate** 1 Interact

The euphemistically named saboteur's friend looks, smells, and tastes like an appetizing chocolate square. You lace the chocolate with reagents that induce a strong laxative effect. Saboteur's friend is useful for incapacitating rather than dealing lasting harm. Unlike some poisons, saboteur's friend can have its sickened condition reduced (but changing to a higher or lower stage after a save applies any sickened condition listed for that stage, as normal).

**Saving Throw** DC 20 fortitude

**Onset** 10 minutes

**Maximum Duration** 1 hour
