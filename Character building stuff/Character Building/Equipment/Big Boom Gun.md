# Big Boom Gun
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-weapons-specific-magic-weapons-big-boom-gun.webp|150]]

Developed by a goblin weaponsmith who missed the 'hand' part of 'hand cannon', this comically-oversized gun has a heavily reinforced barrel and is loaded with a worrisome quantity of gunpowder.

This hand cannon is a martial weapon, instead of a simple weapon. It has the fatal d12 trait and a range of 20 feet. It also has the following modified critical failure condition:

* * *

**Critical Failure** The attack misses, the weapon misfires, and you take 1d12 fire damage as it explodes in your face.
