# Jabali's Dice
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-equipment.svg|150]]

_Jabali's dice_ are two six-sided dice carved from evenly weighted stone to the specifications of a specific jabali shuyookh. The sides showing a 6 also have the name and title of the shuyookh inscribed in Petran. If you whisper the name and title during a dice game using _jabali's dice_, they bless you with a bit of luck, granting a +2 item bonus to your Games Lore check. You can do so frequently enough to apply this bonus while Earning Income using Games Lore, but only one user at a time can do so.

**Activateâ€”Jabali's Gamble** 2 (concentrate, manipulate)

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** You call out the shuyookh's name and title, then roll the dice. The shuyookh appears briefly to provide for your defense. Roll `dice: 2d6` to determine the effect. Represented by the GM, the shuyookh chooses any effect's specifications, benefiting you according to the shuyookh's whims.

| **2-5** | The shuyookh casts _[[Mountain Resilience]]_ on you. |
| --- | --- |
| **6-9** | The shuyookh casts _[[Grasping Earth]]_ but you and your allies are immune to it. |
| **10-11** | The shuyookh casts _[[Wall of Stone]]_. The edges can pass through creatures, which are shunted to the side of the wall opposite that edge. |
| **12** | The shuyookh casts a DC 31 _[[Petrify]]_ spell on a creature hostile and in proximity to you. If no appealing target exists, you receive a 10-11 result instead. |
