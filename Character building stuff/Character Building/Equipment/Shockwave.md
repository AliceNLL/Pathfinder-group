# Shockwave
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-runes-weapon-property-runes-weapon-property-runes.webp|150]]

_Shockwave_ weapons magically increase their density and momentum when swung, creating a thudding impact on those nearby. Strikes with this weapon deal bludgeoning splash damage equal to the number of weapon damage dice. You're immune to this splash damage.
