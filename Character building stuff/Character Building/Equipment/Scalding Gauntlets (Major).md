# Scalding Gauntlets (Major)
![[icons-equipment-hand-gauntlet-plate-gold.webp|150]]

Prized by naari geniekin who prefer to fight with their fists, _major scalding gauntlets_ are a pair of _+2 greater striking flaming spiked gauntlets_. The intricate golden gauntlets are engraved with Pyric writing praising the glories of the Dominion of Flame and embellished with shimmering black and red gemstones. A creature you grab or restrain while wearing the gauntlets must succeed at a DC 32 fortitude save or take 3d6 persistent,fire damage and be [[Sickened 1]] from the pain; it's temporarily immune to being sickened by _scalding gauntlets_ for 1 hour.
