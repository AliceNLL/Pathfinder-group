# Gallows Tooth
![[icons-equipment-neck-necklace-simple-teeth.webp|150]]

**Activate** A (manipulate)

* * *

This grisly molar hangs from a cord threaded through a hole just above its dried, exposed root. When you activate this talisman, make a melee Strike against an adjacent creature. That creature is [[Off-Guard]] against the Strike and until the end of your turn.
