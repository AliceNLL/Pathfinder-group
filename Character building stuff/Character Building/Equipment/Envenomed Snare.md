# Envenomed Snare
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-snares-envenomed-snare.webp|150]]

This snare is coated with giant wasp venom and tipped with needles, which deliver the venom to the first creature to enter the square. That creature takes 4d6 piercing damage (DC 23 reflex) and, on a failure, the creature is exposed to the [[Giant Wasp Venom]].

**Craft Requirements** Supply 2 doses of giant wasp venom.
