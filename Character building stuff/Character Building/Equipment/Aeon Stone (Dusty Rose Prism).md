# Aeon Stone (Dusty Rose Prism)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-worn-items-other-worn-items-aeon-stone-dusty-rose-prism.webp|150]]

This aeon stone allows you to cast the 1st-level _[[Shield]]_ cantrip as an arcane innate spell, surrounding yourself in pink energy.

The resonant power increases the damage prevented by your aeon stone's shield spell from 5 to 10.
