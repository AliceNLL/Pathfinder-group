# Oil of Object Animation
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-consumables-oils-oil-of-object-animation.webp|150]]

**Activate** 2 Interact

This fine golden oil comes in a small blue canister. Carefully spreading the oil over an object turns it into an _animated object_ of the same type. For example, sprinkling it on a statue makes an _animated statue_. If the animated object's level would be greater than 3, the oil struggles to animate it and ultimately fails.

This animated object has the _minion_ trait, meaning it can use 2 actions when you Command it. You can issue a Command for the current turn as part of the activation. The object remains animated for 1 minute before falling inert. As usual, you can have a maximum of four minions under your control.
