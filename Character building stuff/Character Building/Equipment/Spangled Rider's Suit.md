This _+1 resilient_ studded leather is adorned with colorful sequins that sparkle in even the faintest light.

While wearing the spangled rider's suit, you gain a +2 item bonus to Command an Animal you are riding.

Any animal you ride automatically knows the Drop Prone and Step basic actions, in addition to any other basic actions it knows (normally only Leap, Seek, Stand, Stride, and Strike).

**Activate** R (move)

**Trigger** You take damage while mounted or your mount Drops Prone

* * *

**Effect** You dismount, moving off your mount into a space adjacent to it.
