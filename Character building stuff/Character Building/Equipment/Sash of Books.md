This elegant black sash features stylized crimson books embroidered at either end and a set of simple tassels. While wearing the sash, you feel as if you have a better understanding of the people and life around you. You gain a +3 item bonus to Society checks. When you invest the sash, you either increase your Intelligence score by 2 or increase it to 18, whichever would give you a higher score.
