# Kizidhar's Shield
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-armor.svg|150]]

This _standard-grade duskwood shield_ is perfectly symmetrical and incredibly sturdy despite its elaborate construction. These shields are typically given to the chosen emissaries of a kizidhar shuyookh, and the shuyookh's name and title are engraved in Muan behind the shield's handle.

**Activate - Repair**1 (concentrate)

**Frequency** once per day

**Effect** You command the shield to repair itself, awakening the restorative magic within. For the next minute, the shield heals 3 Hit Points each round at the start of your turn.

**Activate - Secure Site** 10 minutes (manipulate)

**Frequency** once per day

**Effect** You place the _kizidhar's shield_ into the ground at the edge of your campsite, which can't be more than 30 feet on a side, then speak the name of the kizidhar shuyookh carved into its handle. The shuyookh briefly appears just long enough to make a sweeping gesture, causing sprawling thorns to grow in an unnaturally symmetrical formation around the campsite, protecting it for the next 8 hours with an effect that's otherwise identical to _[[Wall of Thorns]]_. All creatures within the campsite are then immediately affected by a three-action _[[Heal]]_ spell cast at 4th rank by the shield. After 8 hours, the wall rots away, and the shield can be retrieved as an Interact action.
