# Sense-Dulling Hood (Greater)

Sometimes, an enemy's dangerous special ability makes relatively standard sensory capabilities a liability. From otyugh stench to a harpy's song, plenty of creatures use their prey's senses against them. A sense-dulling hood is a wide, single-use mask designed to be pulled from an airtight package and slipped over the head. The mask grants you a +4 item bonus to saving throws against auditory, olfactory, and visual effects for 1 hour. Since it dulls your senses without depriving you of them, the mask also imposes a â€“1 penalty to rolls and checks using Perception for the same duration.
