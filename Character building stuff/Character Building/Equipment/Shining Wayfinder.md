![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-worn-items-other-worn-items-shining-wayfinder.webp|150]]

A shining wayfinder is a polished silver compass blessed by the power of benevolent deities. It has the usual functions of a [[Wayfinder]], except instead of an activation to cast light, the shining wayfinder has the following two activations.

* * *

**Activate** 2 command, Interact

* * *

**Effect** You hold the wayfinder and ask for guidance. The wayfinder casts _[[Guidance]]_ on you.

* * *

**Activate** 2 command, Interact

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** You call upon the wayfinder's divine blessings for yourself and your allies. The wayfinder casts _[[Bless]]_, with an emanation centered on itself. Once per turn, you can use a single action, which has the concentrate trait, to increase the emanation's radius by 5 feet.
