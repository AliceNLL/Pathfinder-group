Tools that are severely misused or left in malevolent circumstances can develop malicious sapience, dedicated to critiquing those who use them. Such heckling tools are often born from implements useful to adventurers because such people are the likely to misuse tools or leave them in a corrupting situation. When you first set to using the tools, they fuse to you. Used for their intended purpose, the tools telepathically badger and disparage you, mocking your abilities and giving you ill-founded advice.
