# Guardian Staff (Greater)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-staves-cane-of-the-maelstrom.webp|150]]

A _guardian staff_ is formed from ivory strands woven in a diamond pattern and capped with a glowing ruby. Those charged with protecting others value this staff's spells.

**Activate** 1 envision

**Effect** You raise the staff and choose an ally within 10 feet. A ruby-colored plane of force appears like a shield near the ally, granting them a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of your next turn. If you use this action again, any creature you previously granted this bonus to loses it.
