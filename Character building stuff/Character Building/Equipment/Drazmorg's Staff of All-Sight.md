# Drazmorg's Staff of All-Sight
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-staves-staff-of-providence.webp|150]]

This long, gnarled staff looks like several bones fused together, then wrapped tightly with strips of desiccated, gray skin. At the top of the staff, a clump of sinew clasps a small stone orb resembling a large human eye. When the staff is activated, this eye twitches and glances around randomly. When wielding this staff, you gain a +1 item bonus to visual Perception checks.
