# Bottomless Purse
![[icons-containers-bags-satchel-worn-leather-brown.webp|150]]

With a handshake, you traded future wealth for a _bottomless purse_ of gems and other valuables. Using the purse, you can always sell items for their normal sell value during downtime, even if you aren't anywhere near a settlement. You just put them into the purse, and within a day, the proper sale price appears in coins and gems. Once per day, from any distance, the entity that holds your _bargained contract_ automatically sells a common consumable item in your possession, giving you back only half the normal amount for a sold item.

* * *

**Activate** 2 envision, command

**Frequency** once per day

**Effect** You deposit up to 30 gp of gems and coins in a separate pouch of the _bottomless purse_ while thinking of a common consumable item costing that amount of money. You then upend the pouch. The item you envisioned comes tumbling out into your hand.
