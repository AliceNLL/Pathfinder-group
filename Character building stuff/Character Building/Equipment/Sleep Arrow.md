# Sleep Arrow
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-consumables-ammunition-sleep-arrow.webp|150]]

**Activate** A Interact

_Sleep arrows_ often have shafts of deep blue or black, and their fletching is exceptionally soft and downy. An activated _sleep arrow_ deals no damage, but a living creature hit by it is subject to the effects of a _[[Sleep]]_ spell (DC 17).

**Craft Requirements** Supply one casting of _sleep_.
