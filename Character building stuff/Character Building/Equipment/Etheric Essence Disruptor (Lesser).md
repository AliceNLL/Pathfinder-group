**Active**d Interact

* * *

An etheric essence disruptor emits bursts of discordant ethereal energy through a process based upon Stasian etheric-spirit singers, though without the need for a Stasian coil. Etheric essence disruptors attempt to break down the workings of a spell that manipulates spiritual essence. Upon activation, attempt to counteract an active divine or occult spell within the listed range, with the listed counteract modifier and counteract level.

* * *

The range is 30 feet, the counteract modifier is +7 `dice: d20+7`, and the counteract level is 2.
