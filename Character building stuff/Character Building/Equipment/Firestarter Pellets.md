These compacted pellets of bat guano, sulfur, and magical accelerants have long been a staple for spellcasters on the battlefield. Adding a firestarter pellet to a fireball spell produces clinging flames that deal 1d6 persistent,fire damage to all who fail the saving throw against the effect (2d6 persistent,fire damage on a critical failure).
