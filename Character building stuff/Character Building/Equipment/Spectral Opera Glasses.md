![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-worn-items-other-worn-items-spectacles-of-understanding.webp|150]]

These bulky opera glasses are attached to a rod for ease of use. When held up to the eyes, which requires a free hand, you can see up to four times further than normal, and the glasses provide you a +2 item bonus to Perception checks.

**Activate** 1 Interact, envision

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** For 1 hour, anyone who looks through the glasses can see [[Invisible]] creatures and objects, and sees creatures with the spirit trait as solid and substantial (rather than ghostly).
