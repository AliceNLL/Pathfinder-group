**Activate** 1 Interact

For 1 minute your joints loosen and bones thicken, making your body incredibly weighty and difficult to maneuver around.

**Benefit** You gain a +1 item bonus to Athletics checks to [[Shove]] and [[Trip]], to your Fortitude and Reflex DCs against attempts to Shove or Trip you, and to saving throws against effects that attempt to force you to move or knock you [[Prone]].

**Drawback** You gain the [[Encumbered]] condition and can't remove it while under the effects of the mutagen.
