# Magnifying Scope
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-other-attached-items-scope.webp|150]]

These scopes use magically enhanced lenses to extend the range of your weapon and help spot distant foes. The scope grants you a +1 item bonus to visual Perception checks to [[Seek]] creatures through the scope.

**Effect** While gazing through the scope, you zoom in on your targets to make it easier to hit them at a distance. You increase the range increment of the weapon to which the scope is attached by 5 feet until the beginning of your next turn or until you're no longer wielding the weapon, whichever comes first.
