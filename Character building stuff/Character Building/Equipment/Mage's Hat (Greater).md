# Mage's Hat (Greater)
![[icons-equipment-head-hat-belted-simple-grey.webp|150]]

This larger, fancier hat grants a +2 item to Arcana checks, allows you to cast the _[[Prestidigitation]]_ cantrip and can be activated.

Each greater mage's hat has a specific 4th-rank summon spell from the arcane list woven into its fabric, typically _[[Summon Animal]]_ or _[[Summon Elemental]]_. If you prepare arcane spells, you can change the spell to a different 4th-rank arcane summon spell you know when you invest it.
