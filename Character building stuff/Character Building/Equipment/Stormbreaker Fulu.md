# Stormbreaker Fulu
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-consumables-fulus-fulu-fancy.webp|150]]

**Usage** affixed to armor

**Activate** f command

**Trigger** You would be forced to move, you would be teleported, or you would take cold, electricity, or sonic damage.

* * *

This unassuming paper tag is inscribed with magical symbols. When you activate the fulu, it vanishes in a wisp of cloud, and you gain resistance 15 to cold, electricity, and sonic damage until the end of your next turn. For that duration, you ignore difficult terrain from wind and weather, and you can't be forcibly moved or teleported unless the effect counteracts the fulu (DC 40). These protections apply against the triggering effect.
