# Aeon Stone (Pale Lavender Ellipsoid)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-worn-items-other-worn-items-aeon-stone-pale-lavender-ellipsoid.webp|150]]

This aeon stone must be activated to provide a benefit. The resonant power allows you to cast the _[[Read Aura]]_ cantrip as an arcane innate spell.

* * *

**Activate** R envision

**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** A spell targets you

* * *

**Effect** The stone casts a 6th-level _[[Dispel Magic]]_ spell in an attempt to counteract the triggering spell, with a counteract modifier of `dice: 1d20+22`. This can be used only on spells that specifically target you-not area spells that don't have targets. If it succeeds, it counteracts the spell for all targets if other creatures were targeted in addition to you.

Each time you activate this _aeon stone_, attempt a DC 5 flat. On a failure, the stone permanently turns into a _dull gray aeon stone_.
