# Cloak of Illusions (Greater)
![[icons-equipment-back-cloak-collared-feathers-green.webp|150]]

This cloak flows, covering and concealing the wearer's body. The cloak allows you to cast _[[Figment]]_ as an occult innate cantrip. Although naturally a dull gray, while invested the cloak picks up colors and patterns from its surroundings, granting a +2 item bonus to Stealth checks.

**Activateâ€”Draw Hood** 2 (manipulate)

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** You draw the hood up and gain the effects of a 4th-rank _[[Invisibility]]_, with the spell's normal duration or until you pull the hood back down, whichever comes first. While you are invisible, your _figment_ innate cantrip gains the subtle trait, concealing the observable effects of your spellcasting.
