**Activate** A

* * *

Your features become thin and angular. You become swifter and nimbler, but your body also becomes fragile.

**Benefit** You gain a +3 item bonus to Acrobatics checks, Stealth checks, Thievery checks, Reflex saves, and Dexterity-based attack rolls, and you gain a +15 foot status bonus to your Speed.

**Drawback** You take damage equal to twice your level; you can't recover Hit Points lost this way by any means while the mutagen lasts. You take a -2 penalty to Fortitude saves.

**Duration** 1 hour.
