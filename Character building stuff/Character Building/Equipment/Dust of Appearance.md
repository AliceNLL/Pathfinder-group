# Dust of Appearance
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-consumables-other-consumables-dust-of-apperance.webp|150]]

Stored in a small reed, this powder looks like a fine metallic dust. When you fling it in the air, it coats all creatures in a 10 foot burst centered on a point within 5 feet of you. For 1 minute, the coated creatures can't be concealed or invisible, nor can they benefit from _[[Mirror Image]]_ or similar abilities that create illusory duplicates. Any illusions in the area of 3rd level or lower are revealed as such, although this does not end their effect.
