**Activate** Cast a Spell

* * *

When energy courses through these lustrous beads, they glow brightly in the sacred colors of the spellcaster's faith. A _[[Spiritual Weapon]]_ empowered with this catalyst flashes with bright light when it critically Strikes a target, causing the target to be [[Dazzled]] until the beginning of your next turn. The rosary can be used with a _spiritual weapon_ of 4th level or below.
