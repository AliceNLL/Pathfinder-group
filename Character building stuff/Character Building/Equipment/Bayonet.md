# Bayonet
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-weapons-bayonet.webp|150]]

This blade or spike can be attached to a crossbow or firearm but, unlike other attached weapons, can be wielded in one hand as its own weapon. When used as a separate weapon, it can't benefit from any runes or abilities that function only for attached weapons.
