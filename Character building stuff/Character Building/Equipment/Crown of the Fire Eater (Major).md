# Crown of the Fire Eater (Major)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-worn-items-other-worn-items-crown-of-the-fire-eater.webp|150]]

A wreath of flames dances around the rim of this golden crown. You gain resistance 15 to fire.

* * *

**Activate** r command

**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** You take fire damage

* * *

**Effect** You absorb some of the flame that would harm you. Increase your fire resistance from the crown from 15 to 35. Just after taking any remaining fire damage, you regain a number of Hit Points equal to 35 or the fire damage dealt by the triggering attack before damage resistance, whichever is less.
