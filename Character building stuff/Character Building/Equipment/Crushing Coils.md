# Crushing Coils
![[icons-equipment-chest-breastplate-banded-simple-leather-brown.webp|150]]

Made from constrictor snakeskin, the strips of this _+1 leather armor_ wrap around you like an anaconda might wrap around its victim. The first time you roll a 1 on any attack roll or check after donning the armor, it fuses with you and constricts. It constricts anytime you roll a 1 on any attack roll or check thereafter. When the armor constricts, you're [[Restrained]] for 1 round.

**Activate** 1 command, Interact

* * *

**Effect** The armor wraps around you, allowing you to don it by the time the activation finishes.
