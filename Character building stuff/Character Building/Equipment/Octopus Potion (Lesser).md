# Octopus Potion (Lesser)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-consumable.svg|150]]

**Activate** 1 (manipulate)

Eight flailing octopus arms covered in suckers pop out from the sides of your body when you imbibe this potion. The arms share your multiple attack penalty and attempt to [[Grapple]] a random enemy within 15 feet of you. On a success, roll `dice:1d4` to determine an additional effect of the arms, which lasts as long as the target remains [[Grabbed]] or [[Restrained]] by the arms. On subsequent turns, you can use a single action, which has the attack trait, to have the arms either Grapple a creature currently grappled or restrained (with no added effect) or release any creature they currently hold and repeat their initial effect. After 1 minute, the arms disappear and the potion's effects end.

The Athletics modifier is +12 and the Escape DC is 20.

| 1d4 | Added Effect |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | The arms cover the eyes; the target is also [[Blinded]]. |
| 2 | The arms cover the mouth; the target can't speak. |
| 3 | The arms wrap around the limbs; the flat check for the target to use a manipulate action while grabbed is flat dc:7 instead of DC 5. |
| 4 | The arms crush your enemy; the target takes 6 bludgeoning{bludgeoning damage} equal to the potion's level immediately and at the end of each of its turns. |
