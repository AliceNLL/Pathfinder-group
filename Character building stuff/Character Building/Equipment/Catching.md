# Catching
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-equipment.svg|150]]

A _catching rune_ creates a small, magical vacuum that attempts to pull weapons away from opponents. If you can attempt to [[Disarm]] as part of a Shield Block, such as with the Disarming Block feat or this rune's activated ability, a catching shield grants you a +1 circumstance bonus to such Disarm attempts.

**Activate**F envision

**Frequency** once per hour

**Trigger** You Shield Block a melee Strike made with a held weapon

* * *

**Effect** You attempt to Disarm the creature whose attack you blocked of the weapon they attacked you with. You can do so even if you don't have a hand free.
