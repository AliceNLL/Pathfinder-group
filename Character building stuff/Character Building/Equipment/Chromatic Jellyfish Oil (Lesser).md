# Chromatic Jellyfish Oil (Lesser)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-consumable.svg|150]]

**Activate** 1 Interact

Made from several oils of differing hues extracted from jellyfish and rare plants, the layers of chromatic jellyfish oil stack to form a rainbow within their vial. For 10 minutes after consuming chromatic jellyfish oil, you gain resistance 5 to precision damage and extra damage from critical hits. While the effect lasts, you ignore difficult terrain caused by moving through tight spaces that aren't tight enough to force you to [[Squeeze]], and you can move 5 feet per round when you successfully Squeeze (or 10 feet per round on a critical success). You can also [[Crawl]] at half your Speed.
