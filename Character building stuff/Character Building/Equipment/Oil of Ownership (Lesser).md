# Oil of Ownership (Lesser)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-consumable.svg|150]]

**Activate** 1 Interact

You can coat objects of 6 Bulk or less with oil of ownership, or "red-handed oil" as some call it. Once applied, this clear oil remains active for 24 hours. Anyone who touches an object coated with this oil comes away with a red stain that won't wash off for 24 hours.
