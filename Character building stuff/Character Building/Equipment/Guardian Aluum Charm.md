# Guardian Aluum Charm
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-worn-items-other-worn-items-aluum-charm.webp|150]]

A _guardian aluum charm_ grants control over powerful aluumsâ€”metal and stone constructs created by the Pactmasters to help maintain order in the city of Katapesh. As long as you wear a guardian aluum's linked _guardian aluum charm_, that aluum follows your verbal commands.

**Activate** 2 command, envision

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** The charm grants you control over an aluum you can see within 60 feet, as long as the target aluum is level 13 or less. This has the effect of _[[Dominate]]_ and allows a DC 28 will save. If the aluum is currently under the control of someone wearing its linked charm, its saving throw is one degree higher than what is rolled. You can control only one aluum at a time with this activation, and controlling a new aluum ends the effect for one you had previously affected.
