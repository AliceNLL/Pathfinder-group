# Thundercrasher
![[icons-weapons-guns-gun-blunderbuss-worn-brown.webp|150]]

While looking straight down the barrel of this _+1 striking blunderbuss_, the spark gun's magical core is visible amid several reflectors. All damage dealt by a thundercrasher is sonic damage. On a critical hit, the target must succeed at a Fortitude save against your class DC or be [[Deafened]] for 1 minute.

**Activate** 2 Interact

**Frequency** once per hour

* * *

**Effect** You overload the _thundercrasher_ to emit chaotic sonic frequencies that soften earth and stone. When you next fire the _thundercrasher_ it also partially liquefies any natural earth or stone surfaces within range of its scatter trait, making the area difficult terrain.
