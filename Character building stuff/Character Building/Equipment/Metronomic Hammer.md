# Metronomic Hammer
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-weapons-gnome-hooked-hammer.webp|150]]

A polished brass metronome ticks rhythmically within the haft of this _+1 striking gnome hooked hammer_. Gnome adherents of Brigh often attempt to reproduce this item as part of a ritual symbolizing methodical problem-solving and thoughtful craftsmanship.

**Effect** By timing the sweeping arcs of your Trip attempt to the built-in metronome of a _metronomic hammer_, you gain a +1 item bonus to your Athletics check to Trip the target. This item bonus increases by 1 with every subsequent Trip attempt you make with the _metronomic hammer_ against the same target this turn, to a maximum of +3 on your third Trip. The bonus resets to +1 if you successfully Trip the target, if you critically fail to Trip the target, or if your turn ends.
