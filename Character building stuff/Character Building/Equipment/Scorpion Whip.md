# Scorpion Whip
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-weapons-scorpion-whip.webp|150]]

A scorpion whip has a series of razor-sharp blades set along its tip. Unlike ordinary whips, a scorpion whip doesn't have the nonlethal trait, making it deadlier in combat but less effective when the wielder seeks to bring in foes alive.
