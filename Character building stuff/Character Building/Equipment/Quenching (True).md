# Quenching (True)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-runes-armor-property-runes-armor-property-runes.webp|150]]

This rune counters burning and corrosive agents. Armor with this rune reduces the DC of the flat check to end persistent acid or fire damage affecting you from 15 to 5 (particularly effective assistance automatically removes the persistent acid or fire damage).
