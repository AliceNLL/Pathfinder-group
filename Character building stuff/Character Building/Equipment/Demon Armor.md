# Demon Armor
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-armor-specific-magic-armor-demon-armor.webp|150]]

Crafted from black iron, this crude suit of +2 resilient full plate is designed to make you look like a horned demon, with your face peering out of the screaming maw of the beast.

While wearing the armor, you can attack with the helmet's horns. They are a martial melee weapon with the effects of a _+2 weapon potency rune_. They deal 2d8 piercing damage and have the deadly d12 trait. On a critical hit with the horns, the target must attempt a DC 30 fortitude against the Abyssal plague disease. The horns can't be etched with any runes.

If you aren't evil, you're [[Drained 1|Drained 2]] and can't recover from this condition while wearing _demon armor_.

**Activate** D Command

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** You cast _[[Translocate]]_.
