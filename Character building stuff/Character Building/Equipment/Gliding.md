# Gliding
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-runes-armor-property-runes-armor-property-runes.webp|150]]

The armor allows you to make a controlled descent.

**Activate** 1 command

* * *

**Effect** You glide slowly toward the ground, 5 feet down and up to 25 feet forward through the air. Provided you spend at least 1 action gliding on your turn and haven't yet reached the ground, you remain in the air at the end of your turn. Otherwise, you fall.
