# Rebounding Breastplate
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-armor-specific-magic-armor-rebounding-breastplate.webp|150]]

This _+3 greater resilient greater fortification breastplate_ absorbs impacts for later release. While wearing the armor, you gain resistance 5 to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage and resistance 10 to force damage. Keep track of how much damage the armor prevents from enemy attacks, as the armor absorbs that damage.

After 1 minute, the absorbed damage disperses harmlessly and resets to 0. Only damage caused by foes or hazards powers the armor, not damage you take from yourself, allies, or the environment.

**Activate** 1 Interact

**Requirements** Your armor has absorbed at least 30 damage

* * *

**Effect** The absorbed energy explodes from your armor in a pulse of force. Creatures in a 30 foot emanation take 10d6 force damage with a DC 43 fortitude save. On a failure, they're pushed 10 feet away from you, and on a critical failure, they're pushed 20 feet away from you and fall [[Prone]]. The armor's absorbed damage resets to 0.
