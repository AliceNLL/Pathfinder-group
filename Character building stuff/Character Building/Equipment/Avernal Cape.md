# Avernal Cape
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-adventuring-gear-dueling-cape.webp|150]]

Made from preserved crimson worm hide, this thick leather cape can deflect incoming blows without serious damage. It functions as a [[Dueling Cape]] and while moved into a protective position, it also grants you fire resistance equal to twice the relic's number of gifts.
