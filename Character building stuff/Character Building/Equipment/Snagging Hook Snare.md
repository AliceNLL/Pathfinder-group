# Snagging Hook Snare
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-snares-snagging-hook-snare.webp|150]]

This snare snags a creature with its wicked metal hooks. The first creature to enter the square takes 5d8 piercing damage and 5d8 slashing damage, with a DC 27 Basic reflex save.

On a critical failure, the hooks piercing its flesh make the creature [[Immobilized]] until it successfully [[Escape|Escapes]] (DC 27).
