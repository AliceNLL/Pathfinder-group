![[icons-containers-bags-sack-worn-brown.webp|150]]

**Activate** 1 Strike

Each of these unassuming sacks contains enough rotting fruit to provide a fungus leshy with 1 week's worth of rations, along with clusters of stones to help press out the fruit's juices. When you Strike a creature with a sack of rotten fruit, the sack is consumed while the creature takes 1d4 bludgeoning damage and must attempt an DC 15 fortitude save. On a failure, the creature is [[Sickened 1]]. The range increment of a thrown sack of rotten fruit is 20 feet.
