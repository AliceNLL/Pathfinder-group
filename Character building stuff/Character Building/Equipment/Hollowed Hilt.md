# Hollowed Hilt
![[icons-weapons-swords-sword-guard-purple.webp|150]]

A hollowed hilt is a weapon modification that allows a pommel to be detached and its hilt meticulously hollowed out to create a small compartment without greatly affecting its balance. Often used by knight emissaries to hide important missives, this space can hold an object of light Bulk about the size of a scroll. A creature studying the weapon can find the hilt compartment with a successful DC 20 perception check. Any weapon with an appropriate hilt or pommel can be converted into a hollowed one by paying the equipment's price.
