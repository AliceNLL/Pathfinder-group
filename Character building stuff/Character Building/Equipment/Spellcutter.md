# Spellcutter
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-weapons-longsword.webp|150]]

The blade of this _+2 greater striking adamantine longsword_ seems to absorb light from the air around it, giving the impression the wielder is standing in the shadow of a much larger creature.

While _Spellcutter_ is a potent weapon for battling undead and constructs, an ancient restriction on the blade prevents it from harming living creatures; attacks against living beings deal no damage. This restriction doesn't apply to dhampirs or creatures with the [[Negative-Healing]] ability who are otherwise living; the magic of the blade can't distinguish between such beings and undead.

**Activate** 1 Interact

**Effect** Touching _Spellcutter_ to any light source of 12th level or lower (including 6th-level spells with the light trait) instantly extinguishes the effect. If the source of the light is a large flame, such as a forest fire or bonfire, it only extinguishes the light source in a 5-foot radius burst from the point of contact.
