# Umbraex Eye
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-worn-items-other-worn-items-eye-of-fortune.webp|150]]

Like the rest of its form, the eyes of the legendary umbraex darvakka collapse into ashes when the creature is destroyed. Rarely, when the umbraex wishes to impart information beyond its ashen reconstitution, it ejects one of its eyes at the moment of destruction. This large orb hardens into an obsidian-like substance that swirls with captivated motes of darkness deep within. While you hold the umbraex eye, you have lifesense (imprecise) 120 feet.

**Activate** 1 minute (command, Interact)

**Frequency** once per hour

* * *

**Effect** Name a person, event, or location and the umbraex eye shows 1 minute of relevant memory the umbraex witnessed firsthand. The events are displayed as clear images in the eye and accompanied by sound. If the umbraex has no relevant memories, the eye merely flickers with shadows.
