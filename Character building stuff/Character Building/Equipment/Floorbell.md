# Floorbell
![[icons-commodities-leather-leather-patch-brown.webp|150]]

This surprisingly sturdy 3-foot-by-3-foot clay tile resembles a thick pressure plate. It can support up to 500 pounds of weight atop it before it is destroyed. The_floorbell's_nature is obvious at a glance, but mundane or magical means can obscure or camouflage the tile (such as by covering it in scattered leaves or by casting an _[[Illusory Object]]_ spell) to make it harder to detect.

**Activate**2command, Interact;**Effect** The_floorbell_must be activated on level ground. When you do, specify the amount of weight that triggers the_floorbell's_alarm system. When the amount of weight you specify (or more) is placed on the_floorbell_, it emits an ear-piercing wail clearly audible to a range of 150 feet. A_floorbell_can also ring an alarm if a weight you specify is removed from the_floorbell_, such as if you activated it while a heavy sack was on it.
