This dried claw from a mighty beast bestows upon you the ability of a predator. When you activate the claw, you learn to pounce on your prey in one fluid motion. You Stride and then Strike with the affixed weapon against one creature you were [[Undetected]] by. You remain undetected by the creature until after you Strike.
