# Lethargy Poison
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-alchemical-items-alchemical-poisons-lethargy-poison.webp|150]]

Lethargy poison is commonly used in hit-and-run tactics by attackers who want their victims alive; the ambusher retreats until the poison sets in and the victim falls unconscious. Further exposure to lethargy poison does not require the target to attempt additional saving throws; only failing an saving throw against an ongoing exposure can progress its stage.
