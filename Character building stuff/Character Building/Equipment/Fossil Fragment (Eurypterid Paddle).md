# Fossil Fragment (Eurypterid Paddle)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-equipment.svg|150]]

A fossil fragment is a piece of a fossil creature, typically a smaller bone from a larger specimen.

**Activateâ€”Fossil Metamorphosis** 2 (concentrate, manipulate)

* * *

**Effect** You activate the fragment by placing it on solid ground and then speaking its name, causing the fragment to form the full fossilized skeleton of a creature. In creature form, the fragment has the minion trait. Because it's an animated fossil instead of a living creature, it has the construct and earth traits and lacks its normal creature type trait (typically animal). It's also immune to bleed, death effects, disease, doomed, drained, [[Fatigued]], healing, nonlethal attacks, [[Paralyzed]], poison, sickened, vitality, void, and [[Unconscious]]. It can understand your language, and it obeys you to the best of its ability when you use an action to command it. The specifics of each creature, as well as the activation's frequency, if any, appear in its entry below.

The tip of an oar-like limb specialized for swimming becomes a [[Spiny-Eurypterid]] when activated. It can be called upon once a week for up to 24 hours. The eurypterid can serve as a mount for a creature one size smaller than it or smaller, and when it does, it confers the ability to breathe both air and water upon its rider.
