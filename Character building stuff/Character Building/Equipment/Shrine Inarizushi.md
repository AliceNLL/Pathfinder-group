# Shrine Inarizushi
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-consumables-other-consumables-shrine-inarizushi.webp|150]]

**Activate** one minute (Interact)

A splash of sacred sake in the rice vinegar used to prepare this sushi makes it a suitable offering to the goddess Daikitsu and her favored fox servants. You place the sushi before a shrine of the goddess Daikitsu or in a wilderness area that naturally harbors foxes. For the next hour, whenever you are in exploration mode, roll a separate [[Search]] activity check with a +1 status bonus; this does not affect your Speed. If the check succeeds, a fox appears to inform you of this discovery as best as it can, although it cannot speak.
