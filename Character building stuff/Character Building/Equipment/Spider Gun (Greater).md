# Spider Gun (Greater)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-weapon.svg|150]]

A _greater spider gun_ is a _+1 striking weapon_.  It's a distinct type of martial firearm made from the fangs and spinneret of a Large spider. It deals 1d10 poison damage with a range increment of 30 feet and reload 1. On a critical hit, the venom clings to the target and they take Persistent Poison Damage equal to 1d4 + 2 persistent poison. A spider gun does not add critical specialization effects. The gun can be activated to fire webbing that hampers other creatures.

**Activate** 1 Interact (conjuration, magical)

**Frequency** once per round

* * *

**Effect** You fire a mass of webbing at a square within 30 feet. That square becomes covered in webbing for 1 minute. A square covered with the webbing from a spider gun can be cleared by a single attack or effect that deals at least 15 slashing damage or 5 fire damage. A square has AC 5, and it automatically fails its saving throws. The first time each turn a creature in the webbing begins to use a move action or enters the webbing during a move action, it must attempt an DC 25 Athletics check or DC 25 Reflex save against DC 25. On a success, it moves normally through the webbing and clears away the webbing from any squares it enters this turn. On a failure, it treats squares of webbing as difficult terrain this turn, and on a critical failure, it's Immobilized for 1 round or until it Escapes (DC 25) or destroys the webbing.

**Craft Requirements** The initial raw materials for the _spider gun_ must include the fangs and spinneret of a giant spider or other Large spider.
