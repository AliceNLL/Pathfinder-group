# Thunder Sling
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-weapons-thunder-sling.webp|150]]

Tengu use these specialized slings to fire darts further and with greater force than when thrown by hand. A thunder sling uses darts as ammunition. It can also hurl blowgun darts as ammunition but deals 1d4 piercing instead of 1d6 when used this way.
