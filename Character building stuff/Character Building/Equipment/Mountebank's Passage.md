# Mountebank's Passage
![[icons-weapons-guns-gun-pistol-flintlock-metal.webp|150]]

This _+2 greater striking flintlock pistol_ has the odd construction of possessing two triggers, one of soapstone and one of onyx, clearly separated with individual trigger guards. Originally created by a student at Blythir College in Alkenstar, the _mountebank's passage_ has the ability to create temporary linked portals on existing surfaces. The weapon disappeared shortly after its invention, but rumors have circulated that it now belongs to a group of thieves who use it to commit impossible robberies.

**Activate** 1 Interact

**Requirements** the _mountebank's passage_ isn't loaded

* * *

**Effect** You pull the soapstone trigger. Choose a vertical surface within 120 feet. A beam of white energy crackles to the vertical surface and creates a white portal on that surface. Any creature who moves through the white portal comes out through the _mountebank's passage's_ black portal, if one exists on the same plane. Using this activation causes any previous white portal to disappear, even if you don't create a new portal; otherwise, the portal lasts until your next daily preparations.
