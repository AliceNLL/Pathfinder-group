# Feather Token (Ladder) (Ammunition)
![[icons-commodities-materials-feather-blue.webp|150]]

Each feather token appears to be a simple feather from some exotic bird. The feather's shaft, dipped in gold, bears a single arcane rune. Activating a feather token causes it to transform into another object, which then can be used as normal for that object. Each feather can be activated only once, with most of them permanently becoming the item in their description.

**Activate** A Strike from a ranged weapon

When activated, this feather transforms permanently into a 20-foot-long wooden ladder.
