# Climbing Bolt
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-consumables-ammunition-climbing-bolt.webp|150]]

The shaft of this bolt is wrapped with fine twine. When the bolt strikes a solid surface, the twine unwinds and enlarges into a 50-foot-long rope, securely fastened to the surface the bolt struck. The rope can be pulled free with an Interact action and a successful DC 20 athletics check.
