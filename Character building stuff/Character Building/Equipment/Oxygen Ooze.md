# Oxygen Ooze

**Activate** 1 Interact

You can chew on this translucent green ooze to cause it to expand into a bubble of slime that envelops your mouth and nose. For the next hour, the ooze provides breathable oxygen, allowing you to breathe in environments where you couldn't normally breathe. It then harmlessly dries up and falls away.
