![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-worn-items-apex-items-belt-of-giant-strength.webp|150]]

This thick leather belt is decorated with a buckle carved from glittering quartz in the shape of a fist. You gain a +3 item bonus to Athletics checks and a +2 circumstance bonus to Athletics checks to lift a heavy object, Escape, and Force Open.

When you invest the belt, you either increase your Strength score by 2 or increase it to 18, whichever would give you a higher score.
