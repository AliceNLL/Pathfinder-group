# Fulcrum Lattice
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-other-fulcrum-lattice.webp|150]]

This silver and copper framework is shaped to hold four focusing lenses, one behind the other, from smallest to largest. It has a socketed base to be mounted into a stand, such as that found in a lighthouse lantern. The Fulcrum Lattice was specifically designed to hold the four fulcrum lenses from smallest to largest (ebon, crimson, ochre, emerald), and it hums slightly while within 10 feet of any fulcrum lens. A fulcrum lens slotted into the Fulcrum Lattice has no Bulk; the lattice remains at 1 Bulk and can be carried easily. Inserting or removing a lens from the Fulcrum Lattice requires a single Interact action.

The Fulcrum Lattice channels the power of fulcrum lenses joined with it. While you hold the Fulcrum Lattice, lenses socketed into it are considered to be in your hand for the purpose of activating their abilities. When you make a melee spell attack with a lens in the Fulcrum Lattice, you use the highest melee spell attack modifier of any lens in the lattice, or you can use your melee attack modifier with simple weapons if it's greater.
