# Privacy Ward Fulu (Chamber)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-consumables-fulus-fulu-fancy.webp|150]]

This fulu seeks to keep thieves, spies, and unwanted attention away from a room. A depiction of a lock appears in the center of this fulu, which is in turn surrounded by circles of broken keys. When applied to a wall inside a room, all creatures within the room gain an item bonus to Stealth checks against creatures outside the room.

The fulu can shield a room of up to 90 square feet, grants a +2 item bonus, and has a duration of 24 hours. If you become hidden within the room, you automatically become undetected to creatures of the fulu's level or lower.
