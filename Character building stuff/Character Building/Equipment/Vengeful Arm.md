# Vengeful Arm
![[icons-magic-symbols-circle-ouroboros.webp|150]]

Abraxas teaches that an eye for an eye is the basis of law. This tattoo of a coiled viper provides a +1 item bonus to Society checks.

**Activate** 1 envision

* * *

**Effect** Abraxas transforms the tattoo into a weapon of your vengeance. The vengeful arm crawls into your hand and becomes a [[Retribution Axe]]. You can use this activation again while holding the axe to revert the vengeful arm to a tattoo. Like other retribution axes, you can etch fundamental runes into the vengeful arm's retribution axe to increase its potency or to add striking.
