# Compass (Lensatic)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-adventuring-gear-compass-lensatic.webp|150]]

A compass helps you Sense Direction or navigate, provided you're in a location with uniform magnetic fields. Without a compass, you take a -2 item penalty to these checks (similar to using a shoddy item).

A lensatic compass gives you a +1 item bonus to these checks.
