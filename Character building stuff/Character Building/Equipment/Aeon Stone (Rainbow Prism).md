While this aeon stone orbits your head, the flat part of its base tumbles to briefly face creatures you can see within 30 feet, as though the stone is watching them. You can activate this stone in two ways.

**Activate** 2 envision

* * *

**Effect** The aeon stone captures the image of a creature of your size that you can see within 30 feet. It can have up to 3 images captured at a time; if you capture a fourth, you decide which image it replaces.

**Activate** 2 envision

**Frequency** three times per day

**Requirements** The prism is storing at least one image of a creature of your size

* * *

**Effect** The aeon stone casts a 3rd-level _[[Illusory Disguise]]_ on you, which must be of one of the creatures it has currently captured. While you are under the effects of this spell, the aeon stone is [[Invisible]].

The resonant power allows the stone to capture up to 5 images. If removed from the _wayfinder_, you must decide which images to lose.
