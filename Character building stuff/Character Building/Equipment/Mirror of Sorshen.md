# Mirror of Sorshen
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-artifacts-mirror-of-sorshen.webp|150]]

The silvery glass of this oval mirror displays alluring sights. Its dark wooden frame is studded with small green gems and is carved with a pair of sensuous humanoid shapes—one on the edge of each side of the glass.

The _Mirror of Sorshen_ can form a bond with a spellcaster who has legendary proficiency in Arcana or Occultism, who becomes the mirror's owner. Regardless of where the mirror is, as long as the bond remains, the owner is aware of everything the mirror is currently reflecting and can use the mirror's activations.

Whenever an intelligent creature looks in the mirror, they see an image of a person, creature, or item they find powerfully enticing in some way. The specific image varies depending on the observer, even when more than one creature is looking into the mirror at the same time. Observers are [[Fascinated]] by the images in the mirror unless they succeed at a DC 35 will save to end the fascination. At the GM's discretion, a truly innocent creature or a creature that has renounced all worldly pleasures might be immune to the mirror's fascination.

**Activate—Second Glance** D (concentrate, emotion, incapacitation, visual)

* * *

**Effect** You force a creature looking at the mirror to attempt an additional Will save against the mirror's fascination effect, even if they succeeded at their save.

**Activate—Irresistible Desire** T (concentrate, emotion, incapacitation, mental)

**Requirements** The target must be fascinated by the mirror

* * *

**Effect** You control the target for 30 days, with the effect of a critically failed saving throw against _[[Dominate]]_. If the victim sees the mirror again at any point before this duration expires, the control extends for an additional 30 days from the moment it looked at the mirror again. While there is no initial saving throw, the DC to break free due to commands against the creature's nature is 35.

**Destruction** The _Mirror of Sorshen_ shatters into a thousand pieces if an intelligent but completely innocent creature resists the mirror's attraction and then accidentally drops it.
