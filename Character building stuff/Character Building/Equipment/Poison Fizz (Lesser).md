# Poison Fizz (Lesser)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-consumable.svg|150]]

**Activate** 1 Interact

Made from a special mixture of honey and alchemical reagents, poison fizz is a zesty, sweet rock candy that pops and crackles in your mouth. For 1 hour, you have a +2 item bonus to saving throws against poison and being petrified.

**Secondary Effect** 2 (poison)

**Effect** You bite the poison fizz to release its poisonous liquid center and spray green mist in a 15 foot cone. This deals 3d6 poison with a DC 24 reflex. A creature that critically fails is also [[Blinded]] until the end of your next turn and is then temporarily immune to being blinded by poison fizz for 1 hour.
