# Aeon Stone (Agate Ellipsoid)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-worn-items-other-worn-items-aeon-stone-agate-ellipsoid.webp|150]]

This aeon stone allows you to cast 2nd-level _[[Augury]]_ as a divine innate spell once per day.

The resonant power causes the _augury_ spell from the aeon stone to always succeed at the DC 6 flat to give an answer other than "nothing."
