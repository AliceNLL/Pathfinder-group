![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-shields-specific-shields-nethysian-bulwark.webp|150]]

This round shield is often fashioned to resemble the religious symbol of its dual-natured namesake. A _Nethysian bulwark_ is a high-grade cold iron shield (Hardness 10, HP 40, BT 20) that defends the wielder and can explode with retributive force when struck.

**Activate** F envision

**Trigger** The shield becomes broken when performing a Shield Block

**Effect** The shield explodes in a burst of bright light and shadowy tendrils, releasing a 15 foot cone of force that must include the attacker if possible. The cone deals 6d8 force damage to all creatures in the area (DC 34 Basic reflex).
