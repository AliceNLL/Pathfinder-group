# Glorious Plate
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-armor-specific-magic-armor-glorious-plate.webp|150]]

This elegant full plate is embossed with heraldic imagery and never tarnishes or loses its shine. _Glorious plate_ is _+2 resilient full plate_.

In battle, _glorious plate_ sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius, which enemies see as a blinding halo that obscures creatures other than the wearer. When an enemy looks at the wearer, it must attempt a DC 33 will saving throw. The enemy is then temporarily immune for 1 minute.

**Success** The enemy is unaffected.

**Failure** For 1 minute, the wearer's allies within the glorious plate's 10-foot radius of light are [[Concealed]] to the enemy. Allies are concealed only while they remain within the light; if allies enter the light later, they are concealed as well.

**Critical Failure** As failure, except the wearer's allies are [[Hidden]] to the enemy instead of concealed.

**Activate** D command, Interact

**Effect** The armor casts _[[Sanctuary]]_ on you.
