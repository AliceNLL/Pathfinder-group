# Fearcracker
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-consumable.svg|150]]

**Activate** Cast a Spell

A fearcracker contains fragments of broken mirrors and reagents that pop and smoke when consumed. When thrown down in your space as part of a _[[Mirror Image]]_ spell, your and your images' appearance twists nightmarishly. When an image is destroyed, it "dies" in a disturbing fashion, rendering the attacker [[Frightened|Frightened 1]]. This aspect of the spell has the emotion, fear, and mental traits.
