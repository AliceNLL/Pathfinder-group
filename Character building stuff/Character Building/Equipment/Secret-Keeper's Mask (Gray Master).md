![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-worn-items-other-worn-items-secret-keepers-mask.webp|150]]

Each of these full-face masks is made of stitched materials—often including humanoid skin—and has a single, bulbous eye. While wearing the mask, you gain a +1 item bonus to Deception checks to Lie and the mask doesn't impair your vision. The mask can also be activated, with an ability based on its type.

This monochrome mask is made of tattered rags of gray and black cloth and bleached fragments of skin.

**Effect** You create an illusory duplicate of the item you just stole. This duplicate has the appropriate appearance and weight, but it doesn't make sounds or generate smells. The illusion vanishes after 10 minutes, or earlier if anyone examines or manipulates the illusory duplicate (such as to try to use it).
