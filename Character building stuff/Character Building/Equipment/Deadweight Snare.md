# Deadweight Snare
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-snares-deadweight-snare.webp|150]]

This snare is made of magnetized weights and heavy ropes rigged to a trip wire or pressure plate. When a creature enters the square, the magnets and ropes deploy, weighing down the creature's weapons and limbs. The creature must attempt a DC 18 reflex save.
