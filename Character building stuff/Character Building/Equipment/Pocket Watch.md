# Pocket Watch
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-equipment.svg|150]]

This timepiece is a marvel of clockwork and miniaturization; its gears, arbor, and mainspring are immaculately crafted and tuned to maximize precision and reduce time loss. This pocket watch has the properties of a clockwork dial, except it has a maximum duration of 24 hours and is available to characters from Alkenstar.
