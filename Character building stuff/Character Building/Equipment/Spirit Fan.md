# Spirit Fan
![[icons-commodities-materials-material-feathers-violet.webp|150]]

This elegant black, gold-tipped _+1 striking fighting fan_ is adorned with images of three golden leaves and a red rope tassel. If a creature is reduced to 0 Hit Points by a spirit fan, the golden leaves on the fan light up, providing illumination equal to that of a torch for 1 minute.

**Activate** 2 envision

**Requirements** The spirit fan's leaves are illuminated

**Frequency** once per hour

* * *

**Effect** You sweep the spirit fan in the direction of a single target you can see within 30 feet, releasing the life energy in the form of a streak of golden light. The spirit fan goes dark. If the target is a living creature, the energy restores `dice: 3d8+8` healing Hit Points. If the target is undead, it takes 2d8+8 vitality damage (DC 23 Basic fortitude save).
