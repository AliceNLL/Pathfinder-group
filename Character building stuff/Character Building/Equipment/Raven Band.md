# Raven Band
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-equipment.svg|150]]

This armband is woven from overlapping raven feathers, including one large feather from a kadlaka. As long as you wear it, you understand what ravens are saying, but you can't speak to ravens unless you activate the _raven band_.

* * *

**Activate** 1 Interact

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** When you stroke the kadlaka feather, the raven band gives you the effects of _[[Speak with Animals]]_, except that you can speak with and understand only birds, not other animals.
