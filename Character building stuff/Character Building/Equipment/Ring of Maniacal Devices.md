# Ring of Maniacal Devices
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-worn-items-other-worn-items-ring-of-maniacal-devices.webp|150]]

This ring seems like simple tarnished brass, but it enhances your curiosity about traps and devices of all kinds.

You can use an Interact action to pull a set of thieves' tools from the ring. These tools appear in your hand and fold back into the ring if they would leave your possession.

They grant you a +2 item bonus to Thievery checks to [[Disable a Device]] and to [[Pick a Lock]], and the ring's insights grant you the same bonus to Crafting checks to [[Craft]] and [[Repair]] snares and traps.

* * *

**Activate** 10 minutes (Interact)

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** You create a 4th-level _[[Rune Trap]]_ containing _[[Fireball]]_.

You can have only one _glyph of warding_ from a _ring of maniacal devices_ active at a time, even if you have multiple rings, and the spell ends if you lose your investiture in the ring.
