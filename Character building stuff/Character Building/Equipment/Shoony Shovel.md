# Shoony Shovel
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-held-items-shoony-shovel.webp|150]]

This ornate, compact shovel has a golden handle wrapped with beautiful crimson bulette leather. Its silver head never gets dirty or worn no matter how much you use it. Its true magic, however, is in its ability to dig on its own.

**Activate** D command, envision

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** You place the shovel in a starting position and specify the dimensions and direction to dig (such as "Dig down 8 feet in a rectangle sized 30 feet by 40 feet" or "Dig straight ahead for 30 feet"). The shovel then animates and digs on its own at a rate of one 5-foot cube per 10 minutes until the task is complete or it is picked up. It can dig through dirt, gravel, sand, snow, or similar loose material, but the shovel stops digging (or digs around, if commanded) if it strikes stone or another solid material. A _shoony shovel_ can sense if its digging path will cause a building to collapse, harm a creature, or otherwise create significant problems, in which case it automatically stops digging.
