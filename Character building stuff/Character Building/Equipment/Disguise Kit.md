# Disguise Kit
![[icons-containers-chest-chest-simple-box-red.webp|150]]

This small wooden box contains cosmetics, false facial hair, spirit gum, and a few simple wigs. You usually need a disguise kit to set up a disguise in order to Impersonate someone using the Deception skill. If you've crafted a large number of disguises, you can replenish your cosmetics supply with replacement cosmetics suitable for the type of your disguise kit. You can draw and replace a worn disguise kit as part of the action that uses it.
