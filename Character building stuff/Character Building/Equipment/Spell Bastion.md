# Spell Bastion
![[icons-commodities-treasure-token-runed-os-grey.webp|150]]

A _spell-bastion_ rune creates a reservoir of eldritch energy within the shield. A spellcaster can spend 1 minute to [[Cast a Spell]] of 3rd level or lower into the shield. The spell must take 2 actions or fewer to cast and must be able to target a creature other than the caster. The spell has no immediate effect-it's instead stored for later. When you invest a _spell-bastion_ shield, you immediately know the name and level of the stored spell. A _spell-bastion_ shield found as treasure has a 50% chance of having a spell of the GM's choice stored in it.
