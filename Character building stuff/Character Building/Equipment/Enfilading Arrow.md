# Enfilading Arrow
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-consumables-ammunition-enfilading-arrow.webp|150]]

**Ammunition** Arrow

**Activate** 1 Interact

* * *

This arrow splits at the far end of the shaft into five branching arrowheads, making it impractical for single targets but deadly in combat. When you fire an activated _enfilading arrow_, it sails upward and shatters into countless copies. The arrows then rain down in a 10 foot burst at any point within your weapon's first range increment, dealing 6d8 piercing damage to all creatures in the area (DC 25 reflex).

If a creature critically fails the save and you have access to the bow critical specialization effect, the target is [[Immobilized]] and must spend an Interact action to attempt a DC 10 athletics check to pull the missile free; it can't move from its space until it succeeds.
