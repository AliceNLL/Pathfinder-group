# Beacon Shot
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-consumables-ammunition-beacon-shot.webp|150]]

**Activate** A (manipulate)

* * *

The shaft of a _beacon shot_ is studded with tiny flecks of glimmering gemstones. When an activated _beacon shot_ hits a target, it embeds itself into that target and spews sparks for 1 minute. If the target is [[Invisible]], it becomes merely [[Hidden]] to creatures who would otherwise be unable to see it. The sparks also negate the [[Concealed]] condition if the target was otherwise concealed.

A creature can remove the arrow or bolt by using an Interact basic action and succeeding at a DC 20 athletics check.
