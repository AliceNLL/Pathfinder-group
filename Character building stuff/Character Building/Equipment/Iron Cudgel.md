This miniature iron cudgel is typically affixed to a weapon by an iron chain. When you activate the cudgel, you use Brutal Finish, as the fighter feat. You must meet the normal requirements, including those of the press trait.

If you have the Brutal Finish feat, add two additional weapon damage dice on a success or a failure.

**Usage** affixed to a weapon

**Activate** A Brutal Finish

**Requirements** You are a master with the affixed weapon
