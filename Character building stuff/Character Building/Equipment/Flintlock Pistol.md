# Flintlock Pistol
![[icons-weapons-guns-gun-pistol-flintlock-metal.webp|150]]

Though less accurate and powerful than a flintlock musket, the flintlock pistol is a preferred weapon of privateers thanks to its more compact size and affordability. Pirate captains often wear a brace of such pistols in a bandolier so they can draw and fire without stopping to reload.
