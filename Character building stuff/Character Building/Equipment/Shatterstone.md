**Activate** 1 Strike

* * *

A shatterstone is a small ceramic orb, much like a thunderstone. Inside are reactive agents that set up an intense field of sonic vibration when the stone breaks. The bomb grants a +2 item bonus to attack rolls and deals 3d6 sonic damage and 3 sonic splash damage. Much of the sound is ultrasonic, and creatures with sonic weakness that take damage from the bomb must succeed at a DC 30 fortitude save or be [[Deafened]] until the end of their next turn.
