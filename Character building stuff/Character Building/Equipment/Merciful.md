# Merciful
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-runes-weapon-property-runes-weapon-property-runes.webp|150]]

Merciful weapons are sheathed in an unmistakable wispy green aura recognized by both gladiators and guards around the world. A _merciful_ weapon has the nonlethal trait and can't be used to make a lethal attack. Any persistent damage the weapon would deal is negated.

On a critical hit, a merciful weapon causes the target to become [[Fascinated]] with the weapon's wielder for 1 minute, as the target is bombarded with feelings of guilt and remorse. This is a mental effect. If you have access to the weapon's critical specialization effect, you choose whether to use it or the _merciful_ effect.
