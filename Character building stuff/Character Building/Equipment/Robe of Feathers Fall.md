# Robe of Feathers Fall
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-deceivers-cloak.webp|150]]

This dashing travel- (and beer-) stained feathered robe is the result of magic experimentation gone awry. Dared to create a robe that would continually cast _[[Gentle Landing]]_ during a brainstorming session at a local pub, a young wizard got the enchantment wrong. Instead of a robe that would let its wearer float through the air, they got....this:

When you first invest the robe, and whenever you make your daily preparations, roll `dice: 1d6` and consult the following list to determine the type of feathers. 1: crow; 2: duck; 3: ostrich; 4: chicken; 5: goose; 6: peacock. With each step taken, huge amounts of feathers sprout forth from the robe with great force. The feathers make you [[Concealed]] from all other creatures, but also conceal all other creatures from you. Of course, you cannot use this concealed condition to [[Hide]].
