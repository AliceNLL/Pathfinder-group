# Wand of Overflowing Life (3rd-Level Spell)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-wands-specialty-wands-wand-of-overflowing-life.webp|150]]

This alabaster wand has a clear crystal at the tip.

**Activate** Cast a spell

**Frequency** Once per day, plus overcharge

* * *

**Effect** You cast _[[Heal]]_ at 3rd level.

After you cast the spell, at the start of your next turn, excess healing magic wells up from the wand and heals you, as though you cast the 1-action version of _heal_ on yourself at 3rd-level. You gain this benefit only once, even if you cast multiple _heal_ spells from _wands of overflowing life_ in the same turn.

**Craft Requirements** Supply a casting of _heal_ at 3rd-level.
