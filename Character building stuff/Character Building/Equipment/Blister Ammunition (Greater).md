# Blister Ammunition (Greater)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-consumable.svg|150]]

**Ammunition** any

**Activate** 1 Interact

* * *

Blister ammunition is loaded with alchemically processed irritants, such as pollen, pepper, and formic acid. A creature hit by activated blister ammunition must attempt a DC 35 fortitude, losing the action on a failure. An affected creature can use a single Interact action to scratch and sneeze, allowing it to automatically pass the flat check. The effect ends early once an affected creature spends 3 Interact actions scratching and sneezing. These Interact actions don't need to be consecutive.
