# Double-Barreled Musket
![[icons-weapons-guns-gun-double-barrel.webp|150]]

This flintlock breech-loader has two side-by-side barrels. Though less accurate than a standard musket, a double-barreled musket offers versatility in firing options. Many of Alkenstar's famous shield marshals save their earnings to buy a double-barreled musket as their first personal firearm.
