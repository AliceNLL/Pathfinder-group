![[icons-consumables-potions-potion-bottle-corked-fancy-blue.webp|150]]

**Activate** A Interact

* * *

Your features become striking and your voice becomes musical and commanding, though facts and figures become hazy for you and emotion clouds your ability to reason.

**Benefit** You gain a +4 item bonus to Deception, Diplomacy, Intimidation and Performance checks. Your critical failures with any of these skills become failures instead.

**Drawback** You take a -2 item penalty to Arcana, Crafting, Lore, Occultism, and Society checks. Choose one skill in which you are trained; for the duration, you become untrained in that skill. All your failures to [[Recall Knowledge]] become critical failures.

**Duration** 1 hour.
