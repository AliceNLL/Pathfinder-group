# Ghost Scarf
![[icons-equipment-waist-sash-cloth-purple.webp|150]]

This 6-foot-long scarf shimmers with the silvery light of the River of Souls while worn, providing illumination equivalent to that of a candle. You can deactivate or activate this radiance as an Interact action. The dangling lengths of a ghost scarf softly billow in the presence of haunts, granting the wearer a +1 item bonus to all Perception checks and Perception DCs to resolve discovering a haunt or rolling initiative when a haunt triggers.

**Activate** 1 envision

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** The scarf extends silvery threads that wrap around a weapon you carry, granting the effects of a ghost touch property rune to that weapon for 5 minutes. If the weapon already bears a ghost touch rune, you instead gain a +1 item bonus to Fortitude saves against effects from incorporeal undead for 5 minutes.
