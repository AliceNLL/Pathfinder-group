# Implacable
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-runes-armor-property-runes-armor-property-runes.webp|150]]

This substantial rune makes you difficult to hold back. Whenever you are affected by an effect that lasts until you [[Escape]] (for instance, from the [[Grapple]] action or a tanglefoot bag), you become [[Quickened]]. You can use the extra action each round only to Step or Escape.
