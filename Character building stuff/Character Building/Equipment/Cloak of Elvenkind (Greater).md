# Cloak of Elvenkind (Greater)
![[icons-equipment-back-cloak-collared-feathers-green.webp|150]]

This cloak is deep green with a voluminous hood, embroidered with gold trim and symbols significant in elven culture. The cloak allows you to cast the _[[Ghost Sound]]_ cantrip as an arcane innate spell.

When you adjust the cloak's clasp (an Interact action), the cloak transforms to match the environment around you and muffles your sounds, granting you a +2 item bonus to Stealth checks.

* * *

**Activate** D Interact

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** You draw the hood up and gain the effects of a 4th-level _[[Invisibility]]_, with the spell's normal duration or until you pull the hood back down, whichever comes first.

If you're also wearing [[Boots of Elvenkind]], you can activate this ability twice per day, and it allows you to Sneak in forest environments even when creatures are currently observing you.
