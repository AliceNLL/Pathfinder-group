# Toy Carriage
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-held-items-toy-carriage.webp|150]]

A miniature toy carriage is carved from wood and has fully functioning wheels. It can vary in size from 2 to 8 inches long, too small for even Tiny creatures to ride. If pushed or propelled, obstacles and terrain might slow, stop, tip, or divert the carriage's course.

If pushed and released as an Interact action, a toy carriage rolls along the ground up to 20 feet.
