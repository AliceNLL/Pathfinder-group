# Large Bore Modifications
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-other-attached-items-large-bore-modification.webp|150]]

These modifications include a heavier stock and larger replacement barrel designed to increase the stopping power of firearms. _Large bore modifications_ can only be applied to firearms with the kickback or scatter traits, and attaching _large bore modifications_ takes 1 hour, though this time can overlap with the standard time required to maintain and clean your firearm to prevent misfires.

When you attach _large bore modifications_ to a kickback weapon, the circumstance bonus to damage granted by the kickback trait increases from 1 to 2 additional Damage and the Strength requirement to fire the weapon without penalty increases to 18.

When you attach _large bore modifications_ to a weapon with the scatter trait, the radius of the scatter effect increases by 5 feet, but the weapon imposes a -2 penalty on attack rolls if the wielder's Strength score is less than 14. If the weapon has both the kickback and scatter traits, apply both sets of modifications with the Strength requirement raised to 18 to avoid penalties when firing.
