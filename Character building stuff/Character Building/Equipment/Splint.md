# Splint
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-worn-items-other-worn-items-splint.webp|150]]

Splints can be applied to the following joints: finger, hand, wrist, elbow, knee, and shin. They are strapped to the desired area but are more rigid in structure than supports and braces, with metal or wooden bars pulled firmly against the bone structure to provide constant support (ring splints only attach to a single digit). They are a little less flexible, but you still have full use of your limbs and fingers when using one. You still have full mobility of the limb when not wearing it, but the limb becomes painful and feels less secure without the extra support it normally has, which might present physical symptoms.
