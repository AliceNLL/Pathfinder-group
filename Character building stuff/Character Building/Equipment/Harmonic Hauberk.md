# Harmonic Hauberk
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-armor-chainmail.webp|150]]

Rose gold and copper rings in this _+2 resilient chain shirt_ form a vague bird shape. The jingling links tinkle musically, almost like birdsong. While you wear the armor, effects with the auditory trait must first counteract the _harmonic hauberk_ or they have no effect on you.

The _harmonic hauberk_ attempts to counteract _[[Silence]]_ spells cast on you and 4th-level or higher heightened _silence_ spells the first time the armor enters their area (counteract level 4, counteract modifier +20). After failing to counteract a _silence_ spell, the armor can't attempt to counteract the same spell again, even if you leave and enter the spell's area multiple times.

* * *

**Activate** 1 command

**Frequency** once per day

**Requirements** You have a pool of Focus Points and at least one composition spell

* * *

**Effect** You gain 1 Focus Point and immediately use the Focus Point to cast _[[Lingering Composition]]_, using your Performance check to determine the effects of the spell, followed by the _[[Rallying Anthem]]_. You can use this activation to cast those spells even if you don't have the [[Lingering Composition]] or [[Rallying Anthem]] feats.
