# Bloodletting Kukri
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-weapons-specific-magic-weapons-bloodletting-kukri.webp|150]]

This _+1 striking kukri_ has a crimson blade that shimmers eerily in bright light. On a critical hit, the kukri deals 1d8 persistent bleed damage. If the target didn't already have persistent bleed damage when you scored the critical hit, you also gain `dice: 1d8` temporary Hit Points for 1 minute.
