![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-shields-precious-material-shields-orichalcum-shield.webp|150]]

Orichalcum shields' time-bending properties are particularly useful for keeping them intact. The first time each day an orichalcum shield would be destroyed, it is instead left with 1 Hit Point and the broken condition.

The shield has Hardness 16, HP 64, and BT 32.
