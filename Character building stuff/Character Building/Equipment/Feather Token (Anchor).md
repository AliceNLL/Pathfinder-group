# Feather Token (Anchor)
![[icons-commodities-materials-feather-blue.webp|150]]

This feather can be activated only on a boat. When activated, this feather transforms into a massive anchor that causes the boat to immediately stop. After 1 day, the anchor vanishes and the boat can move as normal. The anchor is attached to the boat by a magical chain of force, but the chain can be removed by _[[Dispel Magic]]_ or destroyed (Hardness 30, HP 40).
