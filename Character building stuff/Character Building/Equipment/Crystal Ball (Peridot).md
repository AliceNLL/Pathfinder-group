# Crystal Ball (Peridot)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-held-items-crystal-ball-peridot.webp|150]]

This polished crystal sphere enhances scrying magic. Any visual information received through a spell with the scrying trait that was cast by the _crystal ball_ appears within the sphere, and any auditory information sounds out from the surface of the sphere. When you cast a spell with the scrying trait by any other means while holding the sphere, you can relay any information you receive in the same way, allowing others to see or hear the target.
