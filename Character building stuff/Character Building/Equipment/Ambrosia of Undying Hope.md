# Ambrosia of Undying Hope
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-alchemical-items-alchemical-elixirs-ambrosia-of-undying-hope.webp|150]]

This elixir is usually stored in a small metal flask or miniature stein. The dark liquid sparkles as if it were full of stars and is considered sacred to [[Cayden Cailean]] and to the cults of the Failed in Absalom.

The next time you would die from damage within 8 hours after you drink the ambrosia, it prevents you from dying, you regain 20 Hit Points, the elixir's benefits end, and you become temporarily immune to the ambrosia of undying hope for 24 hours.

The ambrosia can't protect you from death effects or disintegration, but it can protect against almost any other form of death via damage. You can only be under the effect of a single ambrosia of undying hope at a time.
