# Double-Barreled Pistol
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-weapons-double-barreled-pistol.webp|150]]

This flintlock pistol has two side-by-side barrels. Though less accurate than a standard pistol, a double-barreled pistol is a useful and versatile weapon. It's generally banned in areas where duels with pistols are relatively common, in much the same way that arriving at an aristocratic duel with a scattergun would be considered crass, at best.
