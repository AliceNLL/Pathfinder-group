# Ember Dust

This handful of gritty black dust glows faintly, like old coals, but is cool to the touch. When ember dust is sprinkled upon the ground or a flat surface in an adjacent unoccupied square, the dust transforms into a bonfire that fills the majority of the square. For 8 hours, the bonfire blazes regardless of whether it has any fuel.

The fire doesn't harm the surface on which it was sprinkled, and it can't be extinguished except by fully dousing or submerging it in water, or by smothering it completely. Anything that's lit from the bonfire requires fuel to burn and can be quenched normally.

While it's safe enough to move through the space and edge around the bonfire, a creature remaining in the bonfire for at least a full round takes 1d6 fire damage each round.

After 8 hours, the bonfire becomes a normal fire and continues burning only as conditions permit.
