# Storyteller's Opus
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-held-items-storytellers-opus.webp|150]]

This green spellbook with gold trim contains a cautionary story about a boy who was eaten by a wolf after he previously lied about wolf attacks. When opened, the engravings on the front seem to move in a loop, enacting this story.
