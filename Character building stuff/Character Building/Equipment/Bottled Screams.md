The vengeful wails of a revenant, barely contained in this rattling jar, infuse your magic with all of their spite and malice. If a target fails its saving throw against your _[[Seal Fate]]_ spell after you've added this catalyst, it takes 1d6 persistent of the type chosen for the spell (2d6 persistent if it critically fails).
