# Cayden's Brew (Triple)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-consumable.svg|150]]

**Activate** 1 Interact

Cayden's brew is like rich beer or ale, with a golden-brown color and foamy head. For 1 hour after you drink it, you have a +1 item bonus to saving throws against fear effects. Also, you can use a single action to breathe out a 15 foot cone of intoxicating vapor with a burp that can be heard for 100 feet. Any creature in the vapor must attempt a DC 40 fortitude saving throw. After you use this breath weapon, you can't do so again for 1d4 rounds.

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature is [[Clumsy 1]] and [[Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] for 1 round.

**Failure** The creature is clumsy 1 and stupefied 1 for 1d4 rounds.

**Critical Failure** The creature becomes [[Clumsy 1|Clumsy 2]], [[Stupefied|Stupefied 2]], and [[Sickened 1]]. The clumsy and stupefied conditions last until 1d4 rounds after the sickened condition ends.
