# Beckoning Cat Amulet
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-consumables-talismans-beckoning-cat-amulet.webp|150]]

**Usage** affixed to armor

**Activate** F envision

**Trigger** You use a feat or ability to reroll a failed or critically failed Reflex saving throw (such as Cat's Luck or Halfling Luck).

This clay figurine resembles a white cat with a paw outstretched. When it's activated, any allies within 10 feet who also just failed or critically failed a Reflex saving throw from the same source (such as a fireball spell) can also reroll their saving throw and use the better result.
