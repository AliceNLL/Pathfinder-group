# Enveloping Light
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-tattoos-enveloping-light.webp|150]]

This tattoo is a series of six concentric circles that show up as a soft yellow on any skin tone. The marks carry in them a protective force that bolsters your body and soul. The first time each day that someone attempts to Treat your Wounds and rolls a critical failure, they get a failure instead.

* * *

**Activate** 2 command

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** For 5 rounds, your entire body begins to glow, with the effects of a 1st-level _[[Light]]_ spell. At the end of each of your turns during this time, you regain 1d4 Hit Points.
