Old Matsuki's private brew has quite the kick. In addition to making you tipsy, this medicinal wine works wonders in helping to recover from diseaseâ€”including (ironically) drug addiction. Matsuki's medicinal wine functions as [[Alcohol]], except that its saving throw is a DC 18 fortitude save. In addition, upon drinking a dose of Matsuki's medicinal wine, you gain a +2 item bonus to Fortitude saving throws against diseases and poisons for 24 hours. This applies to your daily save against a disease's progression; however, the bonus doesn't apply to any checks you attempt against Matsuki's medical wine itself.
