Carved of seashell, a _torrent spellgun_ is damp to the touch, and seaweed wraps around its grip. You Activate the spellgun by aiming it at one creature and making your choice of a spell attack roll or a firearm attack roll against the target's AC. This spellgun has a range increment of 30 feet. The spellgun blasts a powerful jet of water that deals 12d6 bludgeoning, then disintegrates into sand.

**Critical Success** The target takes double damage and is knocked back 10 feet.

**Success** The target takes full damage and is knocked back 5 feet.
