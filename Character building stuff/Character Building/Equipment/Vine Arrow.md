# Vine Arrow
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-consumables-ammunition-vine-arrow.webp|150]]

**Activate** A (concentrate)

* * *

Leafy stalks protrude from the shaft of this rustic arrow. When an activated _vine arrow_ hits a target, the arrow's shaft splits and grows, wrapping the target in vines.

The target takes a -10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds for `dice: 2d4` rounds, or until it Escapes against a DC of 19. On a critical hit, the target is also immobilized until it Escapes.
