# Buckler
![[icons-equipment-shield-buckler-wooden-boss-brown.webp|150]]

This very small shield is a favorite of duelists and quick, lightly armored warriors. It's typically made of steel and strapped to your forearm. You can [[Raise a Shield]] with your buckler as long as you have that hand free or are holding a light object that's not a weapon in that hand.
