# Heartstone
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-worn-items-other-worn-items-heartstone.webp|150]]

This gemstone grants its wearer a +2 item bonus to saving throws.

Each _heartstone_ is powered by the spirit of a specific night hag. If it's separated from her for 24 hours (or she's been dead for 24 hours), it becomes a nonmagical gemstone. A heartstone allows the hag to use additional occult innate spells: _[[Ethereal Jaunt]]_ (9th level) and _[[Seize Soul]]_ at will, and _[[Shadow Blast]]_ twice per day.
