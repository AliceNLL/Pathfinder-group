# Stunning Snare
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-snares-stunning-snare.webp|150]]

You rig a snare to disorient a creature with a quick bash, leaving it with little ability to defend itself. The trap deals 6d6 bludgeoning damage to the first creature to enter its square; that creature must attempt a DC 31 reflex save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature takes half damage and is off-guard for 1 round and stunned 1.

**Failure** The creature takes full damage and is off-guard for 1 round and [[Stunned 1|Stunned 2]].

**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage and is off-guard for 1 minute and [[Stunned 1|Stunned 4]].
