# Wrist Grappler
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-equipment.svg|150]]

This specialized [[Grappling Gun]], which attaches to your wrist, connects to a spool of 50 feet of thin metal cord attached to a pack on your back. The wrist grappler and pack are small enough that they can be concealed with a loose jacket or similar piece of clothing. You can deploy or stow the gun from the attached wrist device with an Interact action. Reloading a wrist grappler uses the same process as reloading a standard grappling gun and takes 1 minute.
