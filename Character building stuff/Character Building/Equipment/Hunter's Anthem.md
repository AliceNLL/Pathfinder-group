# Hunter's Anthem
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-weapons-specific-magic-weapons-hunters-bow.webp|150]]

This _+2 striking longbow_ is carefully handcrafted from a length of flexible green-tinted wood, etched in a variety of runic symbols, and strung with a dawnsilver bowstring. When you shoot the bow in rapid succession, the echoing chords generated by the bowstring form a haunting dirge that evokes the inevitable end of all things. If you have the [[Hunt Prey]] class feature, the weapon gains the _[[Thundering]]_ rune on Strikes against your prey.

**Activateâ€”Song of the Bow** 2 (concentration)

**Frequency** once per day

**Effect** You shoot an arrow thrumming with the song of the bow. Make a Strike with the bow that deals damage as normal. As long as the Strike isn't a critical failure, the arrow explodes in a 20 foot emanation around your target, dealing 5d10 sonic damage to creatures in the area, including the target, with a DC 28 Basic fortitude. Any creature that critically fails is [[Deafened]] for 1 minute. If any creature in the area is [[Undetected]] or [[Unnoticed]] by you, you learn its location, making it [[Hidden]] to you instead.
