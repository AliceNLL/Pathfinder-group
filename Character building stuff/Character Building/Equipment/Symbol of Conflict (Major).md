This tarnished necklace can be attuned only by someone who is holy or unholy. When you attune it, it transforms into your deity's religious symbol or a personal symbol if you don't have a deity. You receive a +3 item bonus to Religion and a +1 circumstance bonus to saves against holy and unholy effects.
