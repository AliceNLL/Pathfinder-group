# Blade Byrnie (Greater)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-armor-chainshirt.webp|150]]

Instead of chain links, this _+2 resilient chain shirt_ is assembled from metal "leaves" that each resemble a small blade.

**Activate** 1 Interact

* * *

**Effect** You pull a link from the armor, which transforms into a _+2 greater striking [[Dagger]]_. The dagger disappears and reappears as a link in the armor after you Strike with it, or at the end of this turn if you don't make a Strike. You can Activate the blade byrnie in place of an Interact action to draw a weapon for abilities such as the [[Quick Draw]] feat.

Upgrading the runes on the blade byrnie makes the daggers pulled from it more powerful. The daggers have a _+3 weapon potency_ rune if the armor has a _+3 armor potency_ rune.
