# Aeon Stone (Amber Sphere)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-worn-items-other-worn-items-aeon-stone-gold-nodule.webp|150]]

If you are undead, your body regains much of the appearance it had in life, and you gain a +2 item bonus to Deception to [[Impersonate]] yourself as a living creature. If you're alive, your appearance is the healthiest version of yourself, and you gain a +2 item bonus to [[Make an Impression]] or [[Request]] that involves your strength or vigor.

The resonant power of the _amber sphere_ grants you a special activation to improve your salubrious appearance to a lurid extreme.

**Activate** 2 envision

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** The stone casts a 7th-level _[[Mask of Terror]]_ on you (DC 34 will), causing your appearance to burst with a profusion of shocking vigor: your mouth fills with large and bright teeth, your hair animates in grasping tresses, your face flushes with bright blood that seeps from your skin, or similar. The image is unique to each observer, but you remain recognizably yourself regardless of the illusion's form.
