# Mambele
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-weapons-mambele.webp|150]]

Also known as a hunga munga or danisco, this hybrid knife-axe consists of a hilt and a blade that curves backward toward the wielder. The curve of the blade is such that after a victim has been struck by a mambele, more damage is dealt as the weapon is extracted from the victim's body.
