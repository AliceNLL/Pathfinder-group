# Striking Snare
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-snares-striking-snare.webp|150]]

You affix a trip line or other trigger to a group of either stones or wooden stakes to strike a creature that enters the snare's square. The creature must attempt a DC 26 Basic reflex saving throw. If you choose stones, the snare deals 9d8 bludgeoning damage; if you choose spikes, it deals 9d8 piercing damage.
