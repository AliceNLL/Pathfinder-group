# Shield Sconce
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-adventuring-gear-shield-sconce.webp|150]]

This carefully balanced metal bracket can be attached to the front or top of a shield or tower shield (but not a buckler), allowing you to carry a torch without giving up your shield or holding it in your other hand. While carrying a torch in this way, you must attempt a DC 11 flat every time you use the Shield Block reaction; on a failure, the torch is extinguished.
