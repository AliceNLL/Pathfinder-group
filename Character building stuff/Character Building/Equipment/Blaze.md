This acrid blend of black powder, honey, saltpeter, sulfur, and stranger ingredients sees plenty of use in the Mana Wastes, where magical environmental protection is unreliable. Users experience euphoric feelings of warmth and wellbeing followed by intense bouts of dehydration and disorientation.

**Saving Throw** DC 17 fortitude

**Maximum Duration** 4 hours

**Stage 1** +1 item bonus to saves versus fire effects, and you treat severe or extreme environmental heat effects as if they were one step lower (1 hour)

**Stage 2** [[Stupefied|Stupefied 1]], and you treat severe or extreme environmental heat effects as if they were one step lower (1 hour)

**Stage 3** [[Fatigued]] and [[Stupefied|Stupefied 2]] (1 hour)
