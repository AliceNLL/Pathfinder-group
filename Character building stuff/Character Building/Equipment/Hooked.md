# Hooked
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-runes-weapon-property-runes-weapon-property-runes.webp|150]]

A _hooked weapon_ extends hooks when it's used to attack. A _hooked weapon_ gains the trip trait. If a _hooked weapon_ normally has the trip trait, you can attempt to [[Trip]] a foe as a reaction when you critically hit it with the _hooked weapon_.
