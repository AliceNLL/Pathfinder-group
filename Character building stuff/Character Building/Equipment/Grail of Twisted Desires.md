# Grail of Twisted Desires
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-held-items-grail-of-twisted-desires.webp|150]]

This timeworn chalice is constructed of dull tin. It has an unassuming appearance save for the gold, silver, and ebony rings that encircle its rim.

**Activate** A envision

**Frequency** three times per day

* * *

**Effect** The chalice fills with one of three different wines of your choosing, as described below. The wine looks, tastes, and smells the same regardless of which type you choose, and _[[Detect Magic]]_ has no effect on the liquid beyond indicating that it is magical.

*   Ordinary wine.
*   Wine that, when imbibed, casts a 2nd-level _[[Restoration]]_ spell on the drinker.
*   Wine that, when imbibed, casts a 4th-level _[[Nightmare]]_ spell on the drinker.

If you aren't chaotic, the first time each day you activate the chalice, there is a one-in-six chance that the liquid you conjure is a different type (the GM should roll 1d6 as a secret roll) instead. The second and third times you activate the chalice in the same day, the odds of this happening increase to two-in-six or three-in-six, respectively. If you are chaotic, the chalice always works as intended.
