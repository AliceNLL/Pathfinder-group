# Shadowmist Cape
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-equipment.svg|150]]

This black cape flows more like a vaporous liquid than fabric. The cape grants you a +3 item bonus to Stealth checks. When you invest the cape, you either increase your Dexterity score by 2 or increase it to 18, whichever is higher.

If you roll a success, you're [[Hidden]] from that creature until the end of your next turn or until right after you use a hostile action against that creature. If you roll a critical success, you're hidden from that creature until the end of your next turn, even if you use hostile actions against that creature.
