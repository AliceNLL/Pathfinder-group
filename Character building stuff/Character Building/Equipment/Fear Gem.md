# Fear Gem
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-consumables-talismans-fear-gem.webp|150]]

**Activate** D (concentrate)

* * *

Dark smoke seems to writhe within this obsidian gem. When you activate the gem, make a melee Strike. If you hit and deal damage, the target is [[Frightened|Frightened 1]], or [[Frightened|Frightened 2]] on a critical hit.

If you have the Intimidating Strike feat, increase the frightened condition value caused by the Strike to [[Frightened|Frightened 2]], or [[Frightened|Frightened 3]] on a critical hit.
