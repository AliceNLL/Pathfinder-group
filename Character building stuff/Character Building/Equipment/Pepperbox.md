# Pepperbox
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-weapons-pepperbox.webp|150]]

This weapon is a specialty of the smiths of Alkenstar. The pepperbox has three barrels that each hold a single shot, and the shooter can manually rotate the whole barrel assembly to align a loaded barrel with the firing mechanism.
