**Ammunition** arrow, bolt

_Silencing ammunition_ is particularly dense and seems to dampen sounds around it. On a successful Strike, an activated piece of _silencing ammunition_ creates a 2nd-level _[[Silence]]_ effect on the target. The target can resist the effects of the ammunition with a successful DC 25 will.
