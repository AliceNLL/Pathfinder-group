# Duelist's Beacon
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-shields-specific-shields-duelists-beacon.webp|150]]

A spiked glove is attached to the front of this _buckler_, functioning as _+1 striking shield spikes_. Perforations and slits line the defensive side, shining bright light through them when the item's magic is activated.

* * *

**Activate** 2 envision

**Frequency** once per hour

* * *

**Effect** You activate the shield's inner light. Attempt a melee Strike with the duelist's beacon. On a hit, the target must succeed at a DC 22 fortitude save or be [[Blinded]] for 1 round. On a critical hit, the target uses the result one degree of success worse than it rolled for its Fortitude save.
