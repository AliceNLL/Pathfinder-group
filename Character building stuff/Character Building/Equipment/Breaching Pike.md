# Breaching Pike
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-weapons-breaching-pike.webp|150]]

Forged with a heavy metal wedge as a spearhead, breaching pikes are often used by hobgoblin infantry alongside a tower shield. Breaching pikes are particularly effective at damaging enemy shields, leaving large, triangular puncture holes behind.
