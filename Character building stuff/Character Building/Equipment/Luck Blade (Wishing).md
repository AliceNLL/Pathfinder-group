![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-weapons-specific-magic-weapons-luck-blade.webp|150]]

Luck and good fortune bless the wielder of this +3 greater striking shortsword. Luck blades are crafted in a variety of styles, but their hilts or blades always incorporate symbols of luck, such as clovers, horseshoes, fish, ladybugs, or other symbols.

**Activate** R envision

**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** You miss on a Strike with the luck blade

* * *

**Effect** Reroll the triggering attack roll and use the new result. This is a fortune effect.

Some luck blades contain one _[[Wish]]_ when crafted. You can cast this spell as an arcane innate spell while wielding the _luck blade_, expending the spell. A spellcaster who can cast wish can place another wish into the blade by spending 8,000 gp and 4 days of downtime. A wishing _luck blade_ can hold no more than one wish at a time.

* * *

**Craft Requirements** Supply a casting of _wish_
