# Monkey's Fist
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-weapons-monkeys-fist.webp|150]]

Also called a "slungshot", the monkey's fist is a short length of rope ending in a thick knot wrapped around a metal weight. You can tie the loose end of a monkey's fist to your wrist; if you are [[Disarm|Disarmed]], the weapon remains secured to your wrist rather than falling to the ground, though you must use an Interact action to grip it before using it again. A monkey's fist is a martial melee weapon.
