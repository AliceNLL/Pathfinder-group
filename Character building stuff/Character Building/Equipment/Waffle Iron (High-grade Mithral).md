# Waffle Iron (High-grade Mithral)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-adventuring-gear-waffle-iron-mithral.webp|150]]

This set of hinged metal plates features studs on the inside of each plate to provide a texture for the pastry cakes you cook with it. You pour batter on the plates, close the device, and place it on a fire or stove to cook.

Truly fit for emperors and demigods, this waffle iron is made of high-grade mithral. Although most metallurgists are certain that the much more affordable standard-grade mithral waffle iron maintains mithral's full non-stick properties, the super elite insist that only waffles made from high-grade mithral waffle irons conform to the most perfect shape and texture.

Nadian has one high-grade mithral waffle iron for sale emblazoned with an archaic symbol associated with Milani from before she became a deity, supposedly used to make Milani herself waffles during her mortal life. As it's made of mithral, this is an uncommon item.
