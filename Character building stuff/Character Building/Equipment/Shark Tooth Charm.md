# Shark Tooth Charm
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-consumables-talismans-shark-tooth-charm.webp|150]]

**Activate** 1 (concentrate)

* * *

This dried-seaweed bracelet is lined with charms shaped like small shark teeth. When you activate the bracelet, attempt to [[Escape]] using Acrobatics with a +1 item bonus to the check. If you roll a success, you get a critical success instead (if you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead). If you fail the Acrobatics check against a grabbing creature, the creature must either release you as a free action or take 2d8 piercing damage as shark's teeth momentarily emerge from your skin.
