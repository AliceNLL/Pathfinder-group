# Amazing Pop-up Book
![[icons-sundries-books-book-open-turquoise.webp|150]]

Goblin wizards invented the _amazing pop-up book_ to store their spells without written words, though the tradition has been spreading to illusionists from other cultures. These grimoires have colorful covers and open to reveal three-dimensional scenes illustrating various spells. Goblins delight in constructing the books just right so a terrifying creature, like a horse or dog, pops up toward the reader each time a page is turned.

* * *

**Activate** F envision (metamagic)

**Frequency** once per day

**Effect** If your next action is to cast an illusion spell prepared from this grimoire that creates illusory terrain or creatures, such as _[[Mirage]]_, you draw forth the pop-up scene. If a creature succeeds, but doesn't critically succeed, at a saving throw to disbelieve the illusion, then just as their mind recognizes the illusion, a startling—though obviously false—illusion pops up somewhere unexpected in their field of vision, visible to only them, dealing mental damage equal to the spell's level.
