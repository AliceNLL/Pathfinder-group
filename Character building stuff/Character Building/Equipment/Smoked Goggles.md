# Smoked Goggles
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-worn-items-other-worn-items-alchemist-goggles.webp|150]]

These goggles use lenses made out of smoked glass to protect against creatures with gaze attacks. While wearing smoked goggles, you're always considered to be [[Avert Gaze|Averting Your Gaze]], but all creatures have [[Concealed|Concealment]] from you.

The fact that the goggles conceal creatures is part of what grants the wearer the item's benefits. If you have a way to negate the concealment from the smoked goggles, you no longer gain the benefit, either.
