# Tanglefoot Extruder
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-equipment.svg|150]]

**Activate** 1 Interact

This portable nozzle-and-trigger assembly based on spider spinnerets can extrude and weave alchemical adhesives into temporary constructions. As an Interact action, you can attach a tanglefoot bag to the extruder. A loaded tanglefoot extruder can be activated to consume the attached tanglefoot bag and convert it into a 30-foot rope, whip, or net, depending on the nozzle die you choose when activating the device. The created object lasts for 1 hour. The DC to [[Escape]] a created rope (if used to bind a creature) or net is equal to the consumed tanglefoot bag's DC and Escaping destroys the created object.
