# Thousand-Pains Fulu (Icicle)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-consumables-fulus-fulu-fancy.webp|150]]

**Duration** 1 minute

Created by a chirurgeon who threw away morality in search of endless life, a _thousand-pains fulu_ blocks the natural flow of elements in the body. A creature to which the fulu is affixed must attempt a DC 30 fortitude. Failure or critical failure primes the target for persistent damage triggered by a specific condition that must be met within the fulu's duration.

Looking at this black fulu leaves you queasy and cold. The fulu deals 10d6 cold as the target's ki warps and drains. On a failure or critical failure, if the target takes damage from a poison or disease effect or becomes sickened, it takes 2d6 persistent,cold. These effects have the cold trait.
