# Anchoring (Greater)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-runes-weapon-property-runes-weapon-property-runes.webp|150]]

This rune prevents enemies from escaping your grasp by [[Fleeing]] to other planes.

When you critically hit a target with a weapon with the anchoring rune, the weapon casts 8th-level _[[Planar Tether]]_ on the target (DC 38 will{DC 38 Will}, counteract modifier +28), except that if the target critically succeeds at its Will save, instead of having no effect, the _dimensional anchor_ lasts for 1 round. When you hit a target with the weapon but don't critically hit, the target is affected by 4th-level _dimensional anchor_ for 1 round without a save (this still uses a counteract modifier of +28).
