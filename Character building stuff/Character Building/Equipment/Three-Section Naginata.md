# Three-Section Naginata
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-weapon.svg|150]]

A fusion of a naginata and sansetsukon, this three-section weapon has a sweeping, curved blade along each of the outer sections. Though difficult for anyone but an expert weapon master to use effectively, the three-section naginata can be wielded at devastating speed to slice or smash apart a foe.
