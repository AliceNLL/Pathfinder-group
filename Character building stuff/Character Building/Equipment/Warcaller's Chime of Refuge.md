# Warcaller's Chime of Refuge
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-equipment.svg|150]]

This chime's carvings depict a series of warding runes that evoke feelings of serene protection. When activated, you touch the chime to yourself or a willing creature. The target gains the effects of _[[Sanctuary]]_ (DC 20 will save). You can use this chime up to five times per day, but each use must target a different creature.
