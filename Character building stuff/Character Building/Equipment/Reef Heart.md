# Reef Heart
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-armor-coral-armor.webp|150]]

This _+2 resilient coral armor_, often favored by allies of merfolk and aquatic elves, is made of living coral carefully harvested from the ocean depths. Legends speak of a variety of similar coral armors with distinct powers, but surface-dwellers know of _reef heart_ as a magic armor that makes it easier for them to travel under the sea. _Reef heart_ enables you to breathe underwater and gives you a swim Speed equal to half your land Speed.

**Activate** 3 command, envision, Interact

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** You cast _[[Coral Eruption]]_. If you conjure the coral underwater, it ceases dealing damage after 1 minute, but its duration is unlimited. If the magical coral remains in place for 1 year, it becomes non-magical coral from which a reef might grow.
