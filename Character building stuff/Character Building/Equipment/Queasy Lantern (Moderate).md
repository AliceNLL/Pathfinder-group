# Queasy Lantern (Moderate)
![[icons-sundries-lights-lantern-bullseye-signal-copper.webp|150]]

This [[Lantern (Bull's Eye)]] is wrapped in decrepit leather skin. It constantly emits light in a 60 foot cone (and dim light in the next 60 feet). You can close or open internal shutters with an Interact action to block or reveal the light.

* * *

**Activate** 2 Interact

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** You slide in a magical lens that causes the lantern to emit a pale green light and then aim the lantern. All creatures in the lantern's 60 foot cone of bright light (but not those in the dim light), must attempt a DC 29 fortitude save. On a failure, a creature becomes [[Sickened 1|Sickened 2]] ([[Sickened 1|Sickened 3]] on a critical failure). The light then reverts to normal as the lens slides out of place.
