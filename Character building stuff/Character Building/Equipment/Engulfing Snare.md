# Engulfing Snare
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-snares-engulfing-snare.webp|150]]

You arrange a spiky cage of bones, particularly tough vegetation, or other material to spring up when disturbed. The snare deals 9d8 piercing damage to the first creature to enter this square; that creature must attempt a DC 31 reflex save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature is knocked aside by the snare's deployment, taking half damage, and is [[Off-Guard]] until the end of its next turn.

**Failure** The creature is captured by the cage, taking full damage and falling [[Prone]]. It is [[Immobilized]] while it remains within the cage. It can get free by [[Escape|Escaping]] (DC 31) or by destroying the cage (Hardness 5, HP 30, object immunities).

**Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature takes double damage.
