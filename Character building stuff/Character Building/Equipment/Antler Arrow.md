# Antler Arrow
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-consumables-ammunition-antler-arrow.webp|150]]

**Activate** A Interact

Creation of these arrows was inspired by an encounter with a horned archon scout who sought to peacefully restrain their foes. When an activated antler arrow hits a target, bone antlers extend to pin it down. The target must succeed at a DC 16 reflex save or become stuck to the surface, taking the critical specialization effects of a bow.

If the hit with the _antler arrow_ is a critical hit and you have access to the bow critical specialization effect, the DC of the Athletics check increases to 15.
