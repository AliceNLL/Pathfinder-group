The process of creating the _sun orchid elixir_ leaves behind a large amount of thick paste with its own healing properties. Artokus commonly sells this paste to Thuvian natives who can't purchase the elixir proper and uses the income to support his alchemy students.

When you apply the sun orchid poultice, it reduces your _clumsy_, _drained_, and _enfeebled_ condition values by 2.

In addition, the poultice provides a youthful burst of energy, granting you a +3 item bonus to saves and 20 temporary Hit Points for 1 hour.
