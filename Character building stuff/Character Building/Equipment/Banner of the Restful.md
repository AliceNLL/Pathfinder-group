# Banner of the Restful
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-held-items-banner-of-the-restful.webp|150]]

Carried by knights who expect to spend the night in the open, this simple-looking banner is accompanied by a long cross pole from which it hangs. Usually, the banner appears to be a piece of plain cloth; when activated, it automatically adopts whatever insignia the person activating it desires.

**Activate** 10 minutes (command, envision, Interact)

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** You plant the banner firmly in the ground, and a comfortable environment is created around it in a 20-foot radius. Those within the area are shielded against your choice of hot or cold temperatures, gaining the effects of 1st-level _[[Environmental Endurance]]_. The area created by the banner lasts for 8 hours or until it is removed from the ground.

As part of the activation, you can choose to ward the same area with an _[[Alarm]]_ spell. In addition to a mental alert for the person who Activates the banner, the alert sent by the _alarm_ spell also includes an audible alarm with the sound and volume of a hand bell, which has the auditory trait. You choose the password as you decide to ward the area.
