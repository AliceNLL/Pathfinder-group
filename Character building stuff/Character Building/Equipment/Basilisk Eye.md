# Basilisk Eye

**Activate** F (concentrate)

**Trigger** You [[Shield Block]] a melee attack with the affixed shield.

* * *

This slimy green stone glows with a strong light whenever the shield it adorns blocks a melee attack. When the eye is activated, the attacker must succeed at a DC 25 fortitude save or become [[Slowed]] for 1 minute as its body slowly stiffens in partial petrification.
