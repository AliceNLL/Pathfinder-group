# Preserving
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-equipment.svg|150]]

_Preserving runes_ are common among merchants and other travelers who are on the road for weeks or months at a time. Any non-magical food and drink inside a container with a _preserving rune_ remains fresher for longer, taking ten times as long to spoil. This feature doesn't prolong the duration of alchemical items.
