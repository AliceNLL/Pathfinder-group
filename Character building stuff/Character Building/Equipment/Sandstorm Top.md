# Sandstorm Top
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-adventuring-gear-earplugs.webp|150]]

On Tekritanin holidays, children reenacted legendary battles of deities by playing with magical tops. Though the paint on this wooden top has long since faded, its magical runes once gleamed yellow-gold and fiery orange, evoking the color of the sky during a sandstorm. To set the top in motion, wind a string around its bottom and upward along its body, and then throw it while gripping the string.

**Activate** 1 Interact

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** You throw the sandstorm top 10 feet away from you. For 1 minute, as it spins, the top generates a magical sandstorm in a 5-foot radius. Any creature that starts its turn in the area or moves into the area takes 4d6 slashing damage (DC 30 Basic reflex save). Additionally, a creature within the sandstorm must hold its breath or begin suffocating.
