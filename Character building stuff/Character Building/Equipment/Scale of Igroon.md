# Scale of Igroon
![[icons-equipment-shield-heater-steel-boss-red.webp|150]]

Carved from a scale of the kaiju Igroon, this jagged shield refracts light around it in a shimmering haze. A scale of Igroon (Hardness 20, HP 160, BT 80) recovers 4 Hit Points at the start of its wielder's turn. When you [[Raise a Shield]], you can use the [[Shield Block]] reaction with the _scale of Igroon_ to block an attack or effect that deals acid, cold, electricity, fire, force, or sonic damage as well as physical damage.

**Effect** You angle the shield to refract light. Until the start of your next turn, you gain a +4 item bonus to Stealth checks to [[Hide]] and [[Sneak]] and can do so while observed. This bonus ends if you Activate another ability or use the Shield Block reaction.
