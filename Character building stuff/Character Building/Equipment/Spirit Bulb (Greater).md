# Spirit Bulb (Greater)

**Activate** D (concentrate, manipulate)

* * *

This magical bulb is harvested from an ancient grove rich in primal plant magic. When you activate the bulb, you either eat it to have it cast a 6th-rank _[[Plant Form]]_ spell affecting you, or plant it in the ground next to you to have it cast a 6th-rank _[[Summon Plant or Fungus]]_ spell. If you choose the summoning option, the plant or fungus appears where you planted the bulb, and you can Sustain the activation to keep control of the creature.
