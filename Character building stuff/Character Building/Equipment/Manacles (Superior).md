# Manacles (Superior)
![[icons-sundries-survival-cuffs-shackles-steel.webp|150]]

You can manacle someone who is willing or otherwise at your mercy as an exploration activity taking 10-30 seconds depending on the creature's size and how many manacles you apply. A two-legged creature with its legs bound takes a -15-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds, and a two-handed creature with its wrists bound has to succeed at a DC 5 flat checks.
