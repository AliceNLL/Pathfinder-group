# Thumper Snare
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-snares-stunning-snare.webp|150]]

This small box contains a clockwork mechanism that rhythmically thumps the ground, allowing creatures with tremorsense to detect it at up to double their usual range. The mechanism can be wound to thump anywhere from 1 round to 1 minute before falling into useless components.
