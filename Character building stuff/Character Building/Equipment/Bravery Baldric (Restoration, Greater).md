![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-equipment.svg|150]]

A bravery baldric is a belt that wraps around the shoulder and draws on your well of courage. When you critically succeed on a save against a fear effect or reduce your frightened condition to 0, the baldric gains 1 charge, which slightly alters the color, turning it golden. A bravery baldric can hold up to 2 charges, and its charges reset to 0 when you invest it. You can have only one bravery baldric invested at a time.

**Activate** 2 command, envision

**Requirements** The baldric has a charge

**Frequency** once per hour
