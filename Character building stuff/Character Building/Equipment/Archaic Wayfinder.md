# Archaic Wayfinder

**Activate** Cast a Spell

An _archaic wayfinder_ functions as a compass and acts as a repository for one cantrip cast into it. To fill an _archaic wayfinder_, a spellcaster casts the chosen cantrip into the empty device, providing any necessary cost; the spell cannot be one that is normally cast as a free action or reaction.

Activating an _archaic wayfinder_ is the same as the casting for the relevant spell. Once it has been activated, it becomes empty again. An _archaic wayfinder_ can hold an aeon stone and activate its resonant power. An archaic wayfinder counts against the limit of one wayfinder with a slotted resonant aeon stone.
