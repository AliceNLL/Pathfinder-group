**Activate** 1 Interact

These sets of rockets come in pairs and strap onto existing footwear (or a creature's feet). Inserting them and aligning them properly takes 1 minute. When you Activate the greater blast boots to [[High Jump]], you can increase the vertical distance of your High Jump by up to 50 feet. When you Activate them to [[Long Jump]], you can increase the horizontal distance of your Long Jump by up to 75 feet. Additionally, for 1 minute, the greater blast boots continue to boost your jumps. Every time you [[Leap]] during the duration, you can move 30 feet in any direction, or your normal Leap distance, whichever is further.
