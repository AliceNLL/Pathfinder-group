![[icons-sundries-gaming-playing-cards-grey.webp|150]]

**Suit** Hammers (Str)

**Alignment** neutral

* * *

_The Bear_ represents brute force applied to solve unusual problems. As long as you have _The Bear_ invested, you can use Athletics checks to [[Tumble Through]] or [[Squeeze]].

**Activate** 1 Interact

**Frequency** once per minute

**Requirements** Your last action was a successful melee Strike

* * *

**Effect** You attempt to [[Grapple]], [[Shove]], or [[Trip]] the creature you hit with the successful Strike, even if you have no hand free. You gain a +2 status bonus to your check. If you Grapple using a weapon, you can Strike with the weapon only if it has the grapple trait and you Strike the [[Grabbed]] target, or if you cease Grabbing with the weapon. After the effect of the initial Grapple ends, you can't keep a target grabbed with a weapon that lacks the grapple trait. The status bonus increases to +3 if you're at least 17th level.
