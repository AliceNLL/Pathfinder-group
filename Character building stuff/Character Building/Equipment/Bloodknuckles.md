# Bloodknuckles
![[icons-equipment-hand-gauntlet-simple-leather-brown-gold.webp|150]]

These thin cloth wraps, which are illegal to use in Highhelm's organized brawls, blend into the skin and add an edge to your blows. The wraps are _+1 striking [[Wounding]] handwraps of mighty blows_. When you invest the wraps, they gain the effects of a 3rd-level _[[Disguise Magic]]_ spell to appear non-magical and resemble simple bandages. Casual observers are unlikely to notice anything amiss with the wraps, but a creature that succeeds at a DC 25 perception check can notice something is off about them, though they would still need to find other means to discern the magical nature of the wraps.
