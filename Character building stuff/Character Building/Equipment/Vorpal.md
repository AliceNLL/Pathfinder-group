# Vorpal
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-runes-weapon-property-runes-weapon-property-runes.webp|150]]

Originally created as a means of slaying the legendary jabberwock, _vorpal_ weapons prove equally effective against nearly any foe with a head.

**Activateâ€”Snicker-Snack** R (concentrate, death, incapacitation)

**Frequency** You roll a natural 20 on a Strike with the weapon against a creature that has a head, critically succeed, and deal slashing damage

* * *

**Effect** The target must succeed at a DC 37 fortitude save or be decapitated. This kills any creature except ones that don't require a head to live. For creatures with multiple heads, this usually kills the creature only if you sever its last head.
