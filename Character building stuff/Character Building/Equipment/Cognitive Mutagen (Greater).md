# Cognitive Mutagen (Greater)
![[icons-consumables-potions-potion-vial-corked-purple.webp|150]]

**Activate** A Interact

* * *

Your mind becomes clear and cognition flows freely, but physical matters seem ephemeral.

**Benefit** You gain a +3 item bonus to Arcana, Crafting, Lore, Occultism, and Society checks and all checks to [[Recall Knowledge]]. Your critical failures on Recall Knowledge checks become failures instead. You become trained in one Intelligence-based skill \[Arcana, Crafting, Lore, Occultism, Society\], chosen at creation.

**Drawback** You take a -2 penalty to weapon and unarmed attack rolls, Athletics checks, and acrobatics checks. You can carry 2 less Bulk than normal before becoming encumbered, and the maximum Bulk you can carry is reduced by 4.

**Duration** 1 hour.
