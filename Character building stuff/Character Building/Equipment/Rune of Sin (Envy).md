# Rune of Sin (Envy)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-tattoos-rune-of-sin.webp|150]]

This jagged glyph, the envy Thassilonian rune of sin, reacts to abjuration magic. When you Cast an abjuration Spell, you gain resistance 5 to damage from spells until the start of your next turn. This resistance is increased to 7 against abjuration spells.
