# Bound Guardian
![[icons-magic-symbols-runes-triangle-orange-purple.webp|150]]

A bound guardian is a tattoo guardian bonded to your skin, which you can temporarily animate to protect you. If your soul leaves your body, your tattoo guardian might be destroyed (see the sidebar, Bestiary 3 262).

**Activate** 3 command, envision, Interact (conjuration)

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** You animate your tattoo guardian, otherwise using the duration and other parameters of a 4th-level _[[Summon Construct]]_ spell. You can have the guardian Fly Free as part of Activating your tattoo. If your tattoo guardian drops to 0 HP, the activation ends, and the inanimate tattoo returns to your skin.
