# Glimmering Missive
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-consumable.svg|150]]

**Activate** 2 envision, Interact

A glimmering missive sparkles as you compose it. When activated, it explodes, disintegrating into a shower of multicolored motes in a 10 foot burst from a corner of the missive's space. Creatures in the area are covered in sparkling dust that remains luminous for 1 hour. Visible creatures can't be [[Concealed]] while covered by the luminous dust; any [[Invisible]] creatures are concealed while covered in the luminous dust, rather than being undetected.
