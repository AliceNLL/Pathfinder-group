![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-equipment.svg|150]]

The exterior of this egg-shaped brass censer is polished to a mirror-like sheen. Several rings are attached to its sides at regular intervals. The top of the censer's lid is decorated with a pair of intertwining snakes.

**Activateâ€”Light Incense** 2 (aura, manipulate)

**Frequency** once per day

**Cost** incense worth at least 5 gp

**Effect** A piping, reddish smoke pours from the censer in a 20 foot emanation. You choose whether the smoke causes the target's blood to turn extremely hot or transmutes to poison; the smoke deals your choice of fire or poison damage. Each living creature that's in the area or enters it attempts a DC 34 fortitude saving throw, then becomes temporarily immune for 1 hour.

**Critical Failure** The creature inhales a large amount of the smoke, taking 6d6 persistent,fire or 6d6 persistent,acid damage and becoming [[Enfeebled 1|Enfeebled 3]] until the persistent damage ends.
