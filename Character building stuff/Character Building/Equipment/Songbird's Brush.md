# Songbird's Brush
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-weapons-specific-magic-weapons-glaive-of-the-artist.webp|150]]

The blade of this _+2 greater striking holy glaive_ shimmers with a prismatic sheen, as if faintly reflecting a rainbow. A _songbird's brush_ sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius (and dim light for the next 40 feet). When wielded in combat, the sound of the blade cutting through the air creates a soft, musical trill as if produced by a songbird. Sacred to the faithful of Shelyn, a _songbird's brush_ is so named for the fighting style developed by worshippers of the Eternal Rose, which equates its sweeping swings to painting with a brush. A _songbird's brush_ grants a +2 item bonus to Performance checks made to dance or sing as long as the glaive is held in two hands.
