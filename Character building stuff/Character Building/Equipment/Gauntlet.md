# Gauntlet
![[icons-equipment-hand-gauntlet-tooled-steel.webp|150]]

A pair of these metal gloves comes with full plate, half plate, and splint armor; they can also be purchased separately and worn with other types of armor. They not only protect your hands but also transform your hands into lethal weapons.
