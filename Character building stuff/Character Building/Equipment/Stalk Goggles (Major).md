# Stalk Goggles (Major)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-worn-items-other-worn-items-day-goggles.webp|150]]

These black leather goggle frames have no lenses. Instead, when a character puts them on and invests them, the wearer's eyes transform and lengthen into snail-like eyestalks. The wobbly eyestalks stretch out through the lens holes and up over the wearer's head on lengthened optic nerves.

**Activate** 1 envision

**Frequency** once per day

**Effect** By focusing hard, you can watch for enemies in all directions. You gain all-around vision, low-light vision, and a +2 item bonus to Perception checks involving sight for 1 minute; during this time, you can't be flanked.
