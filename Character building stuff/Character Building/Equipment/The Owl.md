**Suit** Stars (Wis)

**Alignment** neutral

* * *

_The Owl_ represents the wisdom of nature and the natural order. As long as you have _The Owl_ invested, it grants a +2 item bonus to Perception checks made to [[Sense Motive]], Survival checks to [[Subsist]] in the wild, and Nature checks made when you activate this card. This increases to a +3 bonus if you are at least 17th level.

**Activate** 1 hour (command, envision, Interact)

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** After spending an hour meditating, you can ask one question of the region's spirits, as if you had just performed a _[[Commune]]_ ritual. Attempt a DC 30 nature check to determine the result.
