# Awakened Cold Iron Shot
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-consumables-ammunition-awakened-cold-iron-shot.webp|150]]

**Ammunition** round

**Activate** 1 Interact

These bullets are formed from a liquefied high-grade precious metal and enchanted to unlock that metal's true potential.

The shot is a high-grade cold iron bullet. The awakened cold iron attempts to disrupt enchantments the target placed on others' minds. You can name a creature you believe to be enchanted by your target or allow the shot to choose an enchanted creature randomly. On a hit, the shot attempts to counteract the enchantment the target is using to manipulate that creature's mind. The counteract level is 9, and the counteract modifier is +27. If you fail (but don't critically fail) the counteract check against a demon or fey, you get a success instead. If you hit a demon or fey with no active enchantment effects on other creatures, the target is [[Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] for 1 minute instead.
