# Blindpepper Bolt
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-consumables-ammunition-blindpepper-bolt.webp|150]]

**Ammunition** bolt

**Activate** 1 Interact

* * *

The head of this bolt is a vented container that smells strongly of caustic pepper. When an activated blindpepper bolt hits a target, it deals no damage; instead the creature must attempt a DC 17 fortitude save. If the Strike was a critical success, the target takes a -2 circumstance penalty to its Fortitude save. At the GM's discretion, a creature with no eyes or olfactory organs might not be affected by this item.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target is [[Dazzled]] until the end of your next turn. It can end the effect early if it spends an action, which has the manipulate trait, to wipe down its eyes.

**Failure** The target is dazzled for 1 minute.

**Critical Failure** The target is [[Blinded]] until the end of your next turn and dazzled for 1 minute.
