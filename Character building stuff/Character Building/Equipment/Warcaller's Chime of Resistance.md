This chime features several elemental runes in its carvings. When activated, it creates a defensive aura in a 5 foot emanation. As you activate the chime, choose acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. You and creatures in the aura gain resistance 5 against the damage type you chose. This aura remains active for 10 minutes. This chime can be used once per week.
