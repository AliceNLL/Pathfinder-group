# Shining Ammunition
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-consumables-ammunition-shining-ammunition.webp|150]]

_Shining ammunition_ gives off a faint glow. When shot, it sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius (and dim light to the next 20 feet) for 10 minutes. If it hits a target, it sticks, causing the target to shed light in the same radius. A creature can remove the ammunition with an Interact action, but the ammunition itself continues to glow for the rest of the duration or until destroyed.
