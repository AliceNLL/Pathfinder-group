# Green Dragon's Breath Potion (Young)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-consumables-potions-green-dragons-breath-potion.webp|150]]

This liquid contains blood from a green dragon. For 1 hour after you imbibe the concoction, you can unleash a green dragon's breath weapon. The potency of the breath depends on the potion's type, based on the age of the dragon whose blood was used to make the potion.

Exhaling dragon breath uses a single action. You create a 15 foot cone of poison which deals 4d6 poison damage. All creatures in the area must attempt a DC 23 fortitude save.

After you use the breath weapon, you can't do so again for 1d4 rounds.
