# Religious Symbol (Silver)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-adventuring-gear-religious-symbol-silver.webp|150]]

This piece of wood or silver is emblazoned with an image representing a deity. Some divine spellcasters, such as clerics, can use a religious symbol of their deity to use certain abilities and cast some spells. A religious symbol can be worn on the body on a chain or pin, or can be held.
