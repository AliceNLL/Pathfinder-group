# Boots of Dancing
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-cursed-items-boots-of-dancing.webp|150]]

These boots act as [[Boots of Elvenkind (Greater)]], but they react wildly to strong physical exertion. While you wear the boots, the curse activates whenever you attempt an Athletics check or Stride more than once in a single round during an encounter. The boots cast an 8th-level _[[Uncontrollable Dance]]_ spell on you, and you automatically fail your save. Once the curse has activated for the first time, the boots fuse to you.
