An _exploration lens_ is a magical glass lens designed for a [[Lantern (Bull's Eye)|Bull's Eye Lantern]]. When light from the lantern passes through the lens, it alters the light to make it easier to perform a common exploration activity with the lantern.

Alternatively, an _exploration lens_ can be installed in a [[Wayfinder]] like an aeon stone. In this case, light (such as that from a [[Lantern (Hooded)]], [[Torch]], or _[[Light]]_ spell) must still pass through the lens and you must hold the wayfinder in your hand for it to function.

There are several different types of _exploration lens_, each granting benefits with a different type of exploration activity. Each type of lens is distinguishable from all the other types by holding it up to a bright light.

**Type: Investigating**

The outer rim of this lens glows faintly when held up to the light.

While activated, the lens grants you a +1 item bonus to skill checks to Recall Knowledge while [[Investigate|Investigating]] by outlining potential clues in a way that triggers your memory.

If you're Investigating something while using the lens, you can always roll a Recall Knowledge skill check appropriate to the investigation for initiative.
