# Accursed Staff
![[icons-weapons-staves-staff-simple.webp|150]]

Iron strips line the body of an accursed staff, capping the bottom and folding into an intricate knot at the top. While wielding an _accursed staff,_ you're empowered by the curses you inflict. If an enemy fails a saving throw against a spell you cast that has the curse trait, you gain temporary Hit Points equal to double that spell's level. These temporary Hit Points last 10 minutes. The enemy must be a significant threat and can't have been a willing subject of the curse.

**Activate** Cast a Spell

* * *

**Effect** You expend a number of charges from the staff to cast a spell from its list.

*   **Cantrip** _[[Daze]]_

*   **2nd** _[[Blood Vendetta]]_, _[[Warrior's Regret]]_

* * *
