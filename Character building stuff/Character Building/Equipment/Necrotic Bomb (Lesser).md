**Activate** 1 Strike

* * *

Necrotic bombs combine reagents most people consider disgusting at best and unholy at worst, creating a life-sucking miasma upon contact with air. A necrotic bomb deals the listed void damage and splash damage, and it sickens the primary target on a critical hit. This damage harms only living creatures.

* * *

The bomb deals 1d6 void damage and 1 void splash damage. On a critical hit, the target is [[Sickened 1]].
