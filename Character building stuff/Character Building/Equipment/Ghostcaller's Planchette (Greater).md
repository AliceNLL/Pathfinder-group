# Ghostcaller's Planchette (Greater)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-equipment.svg|150]]

This miniature wooden planchette is engraved with symbols designed to attract spirits. When affixed, the symbols begin to glow, and the planchette turns slightly insubstantial. The spell DC of any spell cast by activating this item is 38.

*   **Weapon** After you cast a necromancy spell by activating the _planchette_, the affixed weapon gains the effects of both the _ghost touch_ and _greater disrupting_ property runes until the end of your next turn.
