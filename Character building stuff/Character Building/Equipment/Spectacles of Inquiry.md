**Effect** The spectacles key in on someone to show you their social cues in perfect clarity. Choose a creature you can see. You gain a +3 item bonus on Perception checks you make to use [[Sense Motive]] against that creature. This benefit lasts until you Activate the item again in this way. If you're an investigator, you can use this activation as part of the action you take to [[Devise a Stratagem]] or [[Pursue a Lead]], and you can do the latter even though you can't see the creature. You must choose the same creature you chose for Devise a Stratagem or Pursue a Lead.

**Craft Requirements** You are an investigator.
