# Verdant Branch
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-equipment.svg|150]]

Woody vines and branches curl and twist around each other, growing small twigs, leaves, and flowers across the surface of this prosthetic arm or leg.

**Activate**1 command, envision

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** A branch grows from your prosthesis, quickly flowering and then producing `dice: 1d4` ripe and flavorful fruits. A creature can pick and eat a fruit with an Interact action to regain `dice: 2d6+5` healing Hit Points. The fruits wither away after 10 minutes.
