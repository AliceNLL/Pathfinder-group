![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-adventuring-gear-hourglass.webp|150]]

Once used by Pharasma herself, the _Redsand Hourglass_ was stolen from Pharasma's court a millennia ago. While the hourglass is in your possession, you're immune to the [[Paralyzed]], [[Slowed|Slowed]], and [[Stunned 1|Stunned]] conditions.
