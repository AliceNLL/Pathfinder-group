# Transposition Ammunition (Greater)

**Ammunition** any

**Activate** 2 Interact

* * *

Transposition ammunition has a milky-white cast and will sometimes shift position subtly of its own accord. When you activate the ammunition, instead of making your Strike against a foe, you fire transposition ammunition at any unoccupied square you can see within your weapon's first range increment and succeed without making an attack roll. You pull yourself through the Astral Plane, teleporting along with any items you are holding into the square where you shot the ammunition. When you teleport, you can take along up to two willing adjacent creatures. These creatures must each arrive in unoccupied squares adjacent to the transposition ammunition; if there's not enough space for both of them, you choose which one is teleported.
