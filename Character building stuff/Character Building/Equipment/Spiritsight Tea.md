**Activate** 1 Interact or 10 minutes (concentrate, Interact)

* * *

Spiritsight tea exudes a soft blue glow, creating illumination equal to that of a candle. When consumed, your eyes take on a soft glow as well, and you can see [[Invisible]] creatures and objects for 10 minutes; such creatures appear to you as translucent shapes, and they're [[Concealed]] to you. You gain a +1 item bonus to Perception checks to [[Seek]] incorporeal creatures.

* * *

**Tea Ceremony** The duration of being able to see invisible creatures and objects increases to 30 minutes, and the duration of the item bonus increases to 8 hours.
