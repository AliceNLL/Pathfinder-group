![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-armor-ceramic-plate.webp|150]]

Traditional armor from Senghor, ceramic plate alleviates the need for metallurgy and smithing, instead relying on ceramic firing, glazing, and strong cord work with a backing of leather and thick canvas. Ceramic plate that follows Senghor's style is colorful and artistic, and is built with the armor latches armor adjustment.
