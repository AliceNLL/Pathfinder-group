This weapon features stylized etchings of giants. A giant-killing weapon deals an additional 2d6 mental damage on a successful Strike against a giant. Mental damage dealt by this weapon ignores the target's mental resistance.

On a critical hit, instead of being [[Enfeebled 1]], the giant must attempt a DC 34 fortitude save with the following effects.

**Failure** The giant is enfeebled 2 for the next minute and takes 2d10 mental damage.

**Critical Failure** The giant is [[Enfeebled 1|Enfeebled 4]] for the next minute and takes 4d10 mental damage.
