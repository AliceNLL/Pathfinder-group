Bound in sturdy leather, this thick book has several colorful bookmarks and page dividers. Its title and text shift between numerous languages.

**Activate**F envision

**Frequency** once per day

**Requirements** Your last action was to cast a spell prepared from this grimoire that allows understanding of another language, such as _[[Translate]]_ or _[[Truespeech]]_

* * *

**Effect** The grimoire absorbs knowledge of one language translated this way (caster's choice if more than one), allowing its bearer to communicate on a rudimentary level in that language even after the spell's duration has elapsed. The _linguist's dictionary_ can hold one language at a time.
