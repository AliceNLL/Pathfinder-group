![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-runes-weapon-property-runes-weapon-property-runes.webp|150]]

Able to copy itself many times over when thrown until the air is filled with deadly blades, a swarming weapon turns a single weapon into a shower of devastation.

**Activate** 2 command, envision

**Frequency** once per hour;

* * *

**Effect** You fling your weapon and it multiplies as it flies through the air, filling a 30 foot cone. All creatures within the area take damage equal to double the weapon's number of damage dice, with a DC 27 Basic reflex.
