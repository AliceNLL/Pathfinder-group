# Disrupting (Greater)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-runes-weapon-property-runes-weapon-property-runes.webp|150]]

A _greater vitalizing_ weapon pulses with vital energy, dealing an extra 2d6 persistent vitality damage to undead.

On a critical hit, the undead creature is [[Enfeebled 1]] and [[Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] as long as it has the persistent damage from this rune.
