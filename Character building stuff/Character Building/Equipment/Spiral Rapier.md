# Spiral Rapier
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-weapons-spiral-rapier.webp|150]]

An old Taldan dueling weapon from the empire's height, this rapier has a thicker blade than normal, which is shaped into a corkscrew-like spiral well suited to catching enemy weapons. Characters from Taldor have access to the spiral rapier.
