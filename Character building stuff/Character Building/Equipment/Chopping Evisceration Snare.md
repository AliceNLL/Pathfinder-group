# Chopping Evisceration Snare
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-snares-chopping-evisceration-snare.webp|150]]

An almost-impossible number of axes spring out at a target with lethal force. When a creature enters the snare's square, it's nearly buried beneath a storm of sharpened metal, which deals 16d8 slashing damage (DC 33 reflex).
