# False Death
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-alchemical-items-alchemical-poisons-false-death.webp|150]]

Typically used to fake one's death, this poison swiftly causes the imbiber to lose consciousness and suppresses vital signs. A creature examining the unconscious target must succeed at a Medicine check against the imbiber's Deception DC + 4 to determine that the target is alive, and a critical success allows the examiner to determine that a toxin is causing the effect. The false death toxin has an extremely bitter taste (DC 10 perception to detect), making it difficult to trick a creature into consuming the poison against its wishes.
