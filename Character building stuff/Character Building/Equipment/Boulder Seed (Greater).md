# Boulder Seed (Greater)
![[icons-commodities-stone-stone-chunk-moss-grey.webp|150]]

**Activate** 1 Strike

* * *

This bomb is made of volatile fluids that rapidly expand and harden when exposed to air. A boulder seed grants a +3 item bonus to attack rolls and deals 4d4 bludgeoning damage and 4 bludgeoning splash damage, according to the bomb's type. When activated, the bomb fills a 5-foot cube with hardened foam, it creates a boulder as hard as stone (Hardness 10, HP 40) that pushes Large or smaller targets. On a critical hit, the target also falls [[Prone]]. The splash zone fills with rubble, creating difficult terrain. The "boulder" the bomb creates fails all saving throws and loses 1 Hardness per round, disintegrating into fine powder when the boulder's Hardness is reduced to 0. At that time, the difficult terrain the bomb created also disappears.
