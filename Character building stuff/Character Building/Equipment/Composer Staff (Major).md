# Composer Staff (Major)
![[icons-weapons-staves-staff-simple.webp|150]]

A _composer staff_ is short and shaped like an elegant black conductor's baton with a silver tip. When waved through the air, it hums melodically. In this way, you can play it as though it were an instrument, and it grants a +2 item bonus to Performance checks made with it.
