![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-runes-weapon-property-runes-weapon-property-runes.webp|150]]

This rune causes a weapon to transform into pure, brilliant energy. The weapon deals an additional 1d4 fire damage on a successful Strike, as well as 1d4 spirit damage to fiends and 1d4 vitality damage to undead.

On a critical hit, the target must succeed at a DC 29 fortitude or be [[Blinded]] for 1 round.
