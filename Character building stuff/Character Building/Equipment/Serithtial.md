The legendary blade _Serithtial_ is said to have been forged by Iomedae, goddess of honor, justice, and valor. She is an intelligent _+4 major striking holy bastard sword_. Although the sword is made of steel, _Serithtial_ is also treated as cold iron and silver, allowing her to deal more damage to certain supernatural creatures. She glows as bright as a torch, but you or _Serithtial_ can suppress or resume this glow as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. In addition, Strikes with _Serithtial_ deal an additional 2d6 damage against creatures that are worshippers of Zon-Kuthon. While wielding _Serithtial_, against effects created by followers of Zon-Kuthon you gain the benefit of _[[Unfettered Movement]]_, a +4 status bonus to saves against death and void effects, void resistance 10, and suppress the doomed condition.

_Serithtial_ was forged as a bastard sword, and she reverts to this shape when no one wields her, but she can also detect what sort of blade her current wielder prefers and transform into it (choosing from dagger, shortsword, longsword, scimitar, falchion, greatsword, rapier, or bastard sword) using an action, which she does when first held. The wielder can empathically tell _Serithtial_ to transform at any time by using a single action, which has the concentrate trait, after which _Serithtial_ uses an action to transform.

_Serithtial_ is willing to work with almost any partner as long as they are dedicated to defeating the great wyrm Kazavon and the forces of Zon-Kuthon. If you ignore those threats and pursue your own agenda instead, before long _Serithtial_ attempts to seize control of your body (DC 45 will save to resist her control), though she typically remains in control for only long enough to find a more worthy partner. You can attempt a new Will save each day to retake control of your body.

**Activateâ€”Grace of the Inheritor** (concentrate)

**Frequency** once per hour

**Effect** _Serithtial_ spends the appropriate number of actions and casts a 9th-rank _[[Heal]]_ or _[[Ring of Truth]]_ spell (DC 45 for either of the two spells).

**Destruction** If Kazavon or a great wyrm shadow dragon who is a worshipper of Zon-Kuthon uses its dragon breath on _Serithtial_ while she is unattended, the sword melts into a pool of mundane iron.
