**Ammunition** any

**Activate**2 command, envision

* * *

Dimension shot is deep blue black, but motes of light play upon it like stars in the night sky. The activated ammunition allows you to teleport to a location near where the ammunition hits. If you hit a creature, you can teleport to an unoccupied space adjacent to that creature. If you fire at a square, you can teleport to a space that contains that square or an unoccupied space adjacent to it. The teleportation fails if no unoccupied space is available to you
