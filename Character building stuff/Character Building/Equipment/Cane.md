# Cane
![[icons-weapons-staves-staff-simple-spiral-grey.webp|150]]

A cane is a straight cane with a curved handle, shaped like the tip of a hook. Its simple design helps with balance and only slightly assists with taking weight off the affected opposite leg. The cane is typically 2 to 3 feet long but can be lengthened or shortened as needed.
