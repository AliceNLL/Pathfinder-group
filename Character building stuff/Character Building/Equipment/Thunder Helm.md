# Thunder Helm
![[icons-equipment-head-helm-barbute-rounded-orange.webp|150]]

The creator of the original _thunder helm_ tried and failed time and again to craft a reliable, helmet-mounted firearm that enabled hands-free gunplay, but even after resorting to magical enhancements, they were never quite able to realize their vision. The allure of the _thunder helm_ continues to compel certain mindsets in the Mana Wastes, and these items continue to be crafted to this day.

A _thunder helm_ appears as a cylindrical iron helmet adorned with a crown-like display of gun barrels extending out in all directions. A slit in the front allows for limited visibility, while sound is muffled by the inner lining. As long as a creature wears a _thunder helm_, it takes a -1 circumstance penalty to auditory and visual Perception checks but also gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against auditory and visual effects.

**Effect** The helm's gun barrels swivel and aim randomly, then conjure enough gunpowder and bullets to fire in all directions around you. Every creature within a 20 foot emanation takes 4d6 piercing damage (DC 19 Basic reflex). When determining a creature's resistance or immunity to this damage, use the weaker of the target's resistance or immunity to piercing or bludgeoning.
