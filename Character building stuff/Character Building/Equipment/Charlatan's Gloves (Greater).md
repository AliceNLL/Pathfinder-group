# Charlatan's Gloves (Greater)
![[icons-equipment-hand-glove-ringed-leather-yellow.webp|150]]

Tiny silver hooks decorate these fine silk gloves. They grant a +2 item bonus to Thievery and allow you to cast _[[Telekinetic Hand]]_ as an innate occult spell.

If you are also wearing a _charlatan's cape_, whenever you would move an object using _telekinetic hand_, you may instead have it disappear in a puff of smoke and reappear hovering in a space adjacent to yours. This is a teleportation effect. The item hovers until the end of your turn or until retrieved with an Interact action.
