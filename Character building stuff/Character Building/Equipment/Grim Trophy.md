**Activate** A (concentrate)

* * *

This talisman comes in many forms, most often a severed piece of a humanoid creature displayed in some gruesome manner. When you activate the trophy, make an Intimidate check to [[Demoralize]] up to two targets, comparing your Intimidation check result to both of their DCs.
