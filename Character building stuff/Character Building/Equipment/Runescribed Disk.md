This decorative silver disk is inscribed with magical runes, similar in appearance to a miniature teleportation circle but with the runes indicating movement encircled by runes associated with time. When you activate the disk, you flicker out of sight, seeming to teleport directly to your destination as you accelerate your flow of time dramatically for the duration of your move action. Your movement doesn't trigger reactions.
