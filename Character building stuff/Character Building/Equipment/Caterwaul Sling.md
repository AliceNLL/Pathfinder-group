# Caterwaul Sling
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-weapons-sling.webp|150]]

Made of shiny brown leather, this _+1 striking sling_ has a single white thread interwoven into its cord.

**Activateâ€”Unleash Roar** D (manipulate, sonic)

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** You pull the white thread free, then whirl the sling in circles at high speed. It lets out an ear-piercing wave of sound. Each creature in a 30 foot cone takes 4d6 sonic damage (DC 21 Basic fortitude save). Any creature that fails is [[Deafened]] for 1 round, or 1 hour on a critical failure.
