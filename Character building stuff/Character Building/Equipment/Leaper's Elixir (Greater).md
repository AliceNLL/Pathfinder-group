# Leaper's Elixir (Greater)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-alchemical-items-alchemical-elixirs-leapers-elixir.webp|150]]

**Activate** 1 Interact

This tingly solution increases the elasticity and contraction of your leg muscles. For 1 minute after drinking this elixir, you can [[High Jump]] or [[Long Jump]] as a single action instead of 2 actions. If you do, you don't perform the initial Stride (nor do you fail if you don't Stride 10 feet).

The maximum vertical distance you can jump with a High Jump is the same as you can jump horizontally with a Long Jump.
