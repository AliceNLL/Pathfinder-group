![[icons-consumables-potions-potion-vial-corked-labeled-purple.webp|150]]

**Activate** 1 Interact

For 1 hour your joints loosen and bones thicken, making your body incredibly weighty and difficult to maneuver around.

**Benefit** You gain a +3 item bonus to Athletics checks to [[Shove]] and [[Trip]], to your Fortitude and Reflex DCs against attempts to Shove or Trip you, and to saving throws against effects that attempt to force you to move or knock you [[Prone]]. You can attempt to Shove or Trip creatures up to two sizes larger than you.

**Drawback** You gain the [[Encumbered]] condition and can't remove it while under the effects of the mutagen.
