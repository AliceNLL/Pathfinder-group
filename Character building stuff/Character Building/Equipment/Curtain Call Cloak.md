# Curtain Call Cloak
![[icons-equipment-back-mantle-collared-blue.webp|150]]

This blue velvet cloak is cut from the remains of a curtain from a destroyed theater. When worn, you gain a +2 item bonus to Performance checks while acting, orating, or singing, as the cloak makes minor motions to accentuate your performance.

**Activate** 2 Interact

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** You take a bow, spread your arms, and the cloak casts 4th-level _[[Darkness]]_ centered on a corner of your space. This darkness doesn't impede your vision. While the darkness persists, it emits noise like the applauding of a moderately sized crowd.
