# Cloak of Swiftness
![[icons-equipment-back-mantle-collared-blue.webp|150]]

This thin cloak is surprisingly light, as if clouds or the very wind were woven together to make the garment. The cloak grants you a +3 item bonus to Acrobatics checks. When you invest the cloak, you either increase your Dexterity modifier by 1 or increase it to +4, whichever would give you a higher value.

**Activateâ€”Ride the Wind** 1 (manipulate)

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** You tug on the cloak, wrapping yourself in the power of wind. You gain a fly Speed of 30 feet for 1 hour. While wrapped in the cloak, you become translucent, causing you to become [[Concealed]] for the duration.
