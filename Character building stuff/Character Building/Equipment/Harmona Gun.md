# Harmona Gun
![[icons-weapons-guns-rifle-white.webp|150]]

A favored weapon of monster hunters in Arcadia, the harmona gun is a large-bore long gun that fires a heavy, slow-moving round. The gun got its name due to the eerie similarity between the buzzing sound its oversized projectiles make flying through the air and the flight of a fey bird called a harmona.
