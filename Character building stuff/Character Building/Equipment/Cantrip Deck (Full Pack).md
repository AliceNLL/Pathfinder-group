# Cantrip Deck (Full Pack)
![[icons-sundries-documents-document-bound-white-tan.webp|150]]

In an effort to spread the knowledge of magic as widely as possible, worshippers of Nethys discovered a way to bind cantrips into cards accessible even to non-spellcasters. The deck contains thick parchment cards, each roughly half the size of a playing card. In precise, no-nonsense script, each card simply states the name of its cantrip, color-coded based on its school.

This pack contains 24 cards-one of each cantrip in the Core Rulebook.

* * *

**Activate** 1 or more (envision, Interact)

* * *

**Effect** You envision your desired cantrip, causing its card to rise to the top of the deck, and draw the card. The deck casts that cantrip as a 1st-level spell, with a DC of 15 and a spell attack modifier of +5. The card crumbles into dust as the cantrip takes effect. The activation takes the same number of actions as the cantrip you chose takes to cast.
