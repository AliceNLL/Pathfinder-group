# Nosoi Charm
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-held-items-nosoi-charm.webp|150]]

Nosois serve as scribes and messengers to psychopomps. They are rare outside of the Boneyard, so it's common for psychopomps venturing to other planes to carry a nosoi facsimile to aid in their travels. This tiny icon of a masked raven emits twittering sounds in perfect accompaniment to your performances. You gain a +2 item bonus to Performance checks to play an instrument, orate, or sing. You can cast _[[Sending]]_ once per day as a divine innate spell.

**Activate** 3 Interact

**Effect** You twist the base of the charm, and the twittering it emits becomes helpful words to boost your arguments. You lose the item bonus to Performance checks and gain a +2 item bonus to Diplomacy checks to make Requests until you use this activation again.

**Activate** 1 Interact

**Frequency** once per day

**Effect** You gain lifesense as an imprecise sense with a range of 30 feet for 1 hour as long as you continue to hold the charm. This allows you to sense the life force that animates living creatures and the perverse force that animates the dead, though you can't distinguish between the two.
