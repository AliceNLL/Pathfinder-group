# Messenger's Ring
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-worn-items-other-worn-items-messengers-ring.webp|150]]

This silver signet ring changes to match the insignia of a lord or organization you serve (or your own face, if you serve no one else). It grants you a +2 item bonus to Diplomacy checks and lets you cast _[[Message]]_ as an arcane innate spell at will.

* * *

**Activateâ€”Dispatch Messenger** 1 minute (concentrate)

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** The ring casts _[[Animal Messenger]]_ to your specification. The animal is a magical creature that springs from the ring, and its appearance suits the iconography or heraldry of the lord or organization represented by the ring.
