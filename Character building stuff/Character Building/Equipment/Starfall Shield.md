# Starfall Shield
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-armor.svg|150]]

This high-grade adamantine heavy rondache (Hardness 17, HP 100, BT 50) bears a _+3 greater striking shield boss_ and has dents that resemble craters on its surface. While wielding the shield, you have fire resistance 15.

**Activate** 1 Interact

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** You Stride up to three times. This movement doesn't trigger reactions and ignores difficult terrain. At the end of your movement, you deal 6d10 bludgeoning in a 10 foot emanation and 14d6 fire in a 40 foot emanation (DC 40 Basic reflex, with the results applying to both the bludgeoning and fire damage). The space where you end your movement and all adjacent spaces become difficult terrain for 1 minute, and the shield glows red-hot for 10 minutes, during which it gains the effect of the greater flaming property rune.
