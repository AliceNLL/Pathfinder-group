# Tekko-Kagi
![[icons-weapons-fist-claw-grey-black.webp|150]]

Four curved blades attached to a sturdy handlebar give the wielder of this close-combat weapon the illusion of having claws that extend from their fist. Adherents of [[Bastet|Bastet ]] favor the tekko-kagi for catching their foes off guard.
