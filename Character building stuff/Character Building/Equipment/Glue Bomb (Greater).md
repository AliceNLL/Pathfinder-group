# Glue Bomb (Greater)
![[icons-containers-bags-sack-simple-leather-tan.webp|150]]

**Activate** 1 Strike

* * *

A glue bomb is a harmless explosive mechanism bursting with sticky substances. When you hit a creature with a glue bomb, that creature takes a -15 status penalty to its Speeds for 1 minute. You gain a +2 item bonus to attack rolls, and the [[Escape]] DC is 28.

On a critical hit, a creature in contact with a solid surface becomes stuck to the surface and [[Immobilized]] for 1 round, and a creature flying via wings has its wings tangled, causing it to fall safely to the ground and become unable to Fly again for 1 round. Glue bombs are not effective when used on a creature that is in water.

The target can end any effects by Escaping or spending a total of 3 Interact actions to carefully remove the sticky substances. These Interact actions don't have to be consecutive, and other creatures can provide the actions as well.
