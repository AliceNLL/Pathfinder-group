# Aeon Stone (Polished Pebble)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-worn-items-other-worn-items-aeon-stone-agate-ellipsoid.webp|150]]

A _polished pebble aeon stone_ imbues you with the strength of the earth, granting a +1 item bonus to Fortitude saves and DCs against attempts to grapple or swallow you.

The stone's resonant power allows you to cast _[[Grease]]_ as a primal innate spell once per day. You can target only surfaces, not objects, with this spell.
