Life shot is a special cartridge that carries a small dose of elixir of life. A creature hit by activated life shot takes no damage from the successful attack, instead receiving 1d4 healing and gaining a +1 item bonus to saving throws against diseases and poisons for 1 minute. On a critical hit, roll the healing received twice and take the better result (this is a fortune effect). A target willing to be hit by this attack is [[Off-Guard]] against it.
