# Smoking Sword
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-weapons-specific-magic-weapons-smoking-sword.webp|150]]

Smoke constantly belches from this +1 magic longsword. Any hit with this sword deals 1 extra fire damage. You can use a special action while holding the sword to command the blade's edges to light on fire.

**Stoke Flames** A (concentrate)

Until the end of your turn, the blade deals 1d6 extra fire damage instead of just 1. After you use this action, you can't use it again for 10 minutes.
