# Staff-Storing Shield (Greater)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-shields-specific-shields-staff-storing-shield.webp|150]]

This magically _reinforced wooden shield_ normally has a blank face. It can absorb a staff and transform between a shield and staff. When you prepare a staff, you can hold it up to the shield, at which point the items will merge, and the shield's face becomes an image corresponding to the type of magic, such as a skull for a staff of necromancy.

**Activate** 1 Interact

**Effect** You change the staff-storing shield from its shield form into the stored staff, which has an image of the shield on it, or change it from the stored staff back into a shield.
