# Wondrous Figurine (Candy Constrictor)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-held-items-wondrous-figurine-candy-constrictor.webp|150]]

Although appearing as a multicolored piece of stick candy, this figurine bears a narrow snake head at one end and is as durable as stone.

When activated, it becomes a rainbow-striped [[Ball-Python]] except it lacks the Stealth skill.

The snake can be used once per day, and it can remain in snake form for up to 20 minutes.
