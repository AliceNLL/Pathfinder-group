# Reaper's Spellgun

**Activate** 2 Interact, Strike

* * *

A rod of blackened bone with a bulb at one end comprises a _reaper's spellgun_, which feels heavier than it looks. You Activate the spellgun by aiming it at one creature and making your choice of a spell attack roll or a firearm attack roll against the target's AC. This spellgun has a range increment of 30 feet. The spellgun fires a shadowy ray, then dissolves into gray mist.

**Critical Success** The target takes 4d6 void and is [[Drained 1|Drained 2]] and [[Doomed|Doomed 1]]. If it had fewer than half its maximum Hit Points after taking the void damage, it's [[Drained 1|Drained 3]] instead. If the Hit Point loss from being drained drops the creature to 0 Hit Points, it dies.

**Success** As critical success, but for the drained condition, the target is [[Drained 1]], or drained 2 if it had fewer than half its maximum HP.
