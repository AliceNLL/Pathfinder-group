Each of these full-face masks is made of stitched materials—often including humanoid skin—and has a single, bulbous eye. While wearing the mask, you gain a +1 item bonus to Deception checks to Lie and the mask doesn't impair your vision. The mask can also be activated, with an ability based on its type.

This mask is a patchwork of tanned skins, each with a distinctive scar. It is contorted into a caricature of a face with a leering eye.
