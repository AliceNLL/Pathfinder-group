# Lawbringer's Lasso
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-held-items-lawbringers-lasso.webp|150]]

This enchanted lasso is a [[Net]] that can be used to [[Grapple]] creatures up to 30 feet away, requires a DC 18 athletics check to [[Force Open]], and has an [[Escape]] DC of 18. It's permanently attached to a 30-foot rope. While using the lawbringer's lasso to Grapple, you receive a +1 item bonus to Grapple checks against creatures with the chaotic trait. If you roll a critical failure on your attempt to Grapple a chaotic creature with the lawbringer's lasso, you get a failure instead.
