# Pendant of the Occult
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-worn-items-other-worn-items-pendant-of-the-occult.webp|150]]

This amulet is hollow and shaped in the form of an unblinking eye. Its cavity typically holds some fragment of occult text. While wearing the pendant, you gain a +1 item bonus to Occultism checks, and you can cast the _[[Guidance]]_ cantrip as an occult innate spell.
