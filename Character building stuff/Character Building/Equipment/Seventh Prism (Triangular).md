# Seventh Prism (Triangular)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-consumable.svg|150]]

**Activate** Cast a Spell

Beloved by the church of the Seventh Veil, a _seventh prism_ is a crystal that disperses its internal light, casting an aurora of color. If you use a seventh prism to cast _[[Dizzying Colors]]_, targets are [[Dazzled]] for twice as long as their saving throw indicates. On a critical failure, the target is dazzled for 1 minute after its [[Blinded]] condition ends. Motes of shifting rainbow hues cloud the eyes, making it difficult to see details.
