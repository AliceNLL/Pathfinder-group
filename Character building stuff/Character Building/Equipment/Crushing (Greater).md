# Crushing (Greater)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-runes-weapon-property-runes-weapon-property-runes.webp|150]]

Weapons with this rune empower your strength, and attacks with these weapons leave your foe staggered. When you critically hit a target with this weapon, your target becomes [[Clumsy 1|Clumsy 2]] and [[Enfeebled 1|Enfeebled 2]] until the end of your next turn.
