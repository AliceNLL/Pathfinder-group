# Noppera-Bo Hood
![[icons-equipment-head-cap-simple-leather-tan.webp|150]]

This unpleasant-looking hood appears to be a completely smooth, round sack of skin that feels uncannily warm to the touch. When you wear this hood and invest it, it merges with your head and face, becoming imperceptible as a worn item except on close examination, which reveals a slight oily sheen to your facial features. You can cause minor shifts and changes to your features while wearing a _noppera-bo hood_; this counts as having a [[Disguise Kit]] to Impersonate any creature that is the same ancestry as you.

**Activate** 2 envision (transmutation)

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** You focus on the hood's magic, and then gain the effects of 1st-level _[[Illusory Disguise]]_, though it's a transmutation effect rather than an illusion.
