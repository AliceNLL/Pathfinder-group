# Draconic Toxin Bottle
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-consumable.svg|150]]

This glass bottle appears to be a dragon's breath potion of a specific dragon type (usually red) but has been polluted, making it toxic to use.

**Activate** 1 Interact

* * *

**Effect** You drink from the bottle and must succeed at a DC 25 fortitude saving throw or become [[Sickened 1]] ([[Sickened 1|Sickened 2]] on a critical failure) and immediately vomit the potion directly onto yourself, taking damage as though you had failed a save against a standard dragon's breath potion. If you succeed at your Fortitude save, you become sickened 1 but otherwise are able to unleash a breath weapon as normal for a dragon's breath potion of the appropriate type.
