# Bi-Resonant Wayfinder
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-worn-items-other-worn-items-bi-resonant-wayfinder.webp|150]]

A _bi-resonant wayfinder_ is inlaid with intricate platinum wires in a complex array of conduits for magical energy. These conduits control the resonant interference of aeon stones.

A _bi-resonant wayfinder_ works just like a regular [[Wayfinder]] except it has two aeon stone slots, and the aeon stones in both slots grant their resonant powers without interfering with each other. The _bi-resonant wayfinder_ and the two aeon stones count as two items toward your investiture limit.
