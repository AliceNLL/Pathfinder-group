# Bestiary of Metamorphosis
![[icons-sundries-books-book-tooled-gold-brown.webp|150]]

This grimoire fancifully illustrates the spells you inscribe within it with illuminated drawings of creatures that have never existed, the pictures changing to depict new ones from time to time.

* * *

**Activate** 1 envision (polymorph, transmutation)

**Frequency** once per day

**Requirements** You're under the effect of a polymorph spell you prepared from this grimoire that offers a choice of multiple forms

* * *

**Effect** You transform into a different form allowed by the polymorph by bending and molding the spell's energy. This reduces the spell's remaining duration by half.
