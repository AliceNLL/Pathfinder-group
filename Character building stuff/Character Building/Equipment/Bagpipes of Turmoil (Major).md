# Bagpipes of Turmoil (Major)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-equipment.svg|150]]

While those who appreciate bagpipes may like the sound of this gray reed and black leather instrument, its real purpose is to sow turmoil against a performer's enemies, spreading discord with each note. While playing the bagpipes, you gain a +2 item bonus to Performance checks and to Intimidation checks made to [[Demoralize]].
