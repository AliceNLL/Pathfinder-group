# Ganjay Book (1 bulk book)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-held-items-ganjay-book.webp|150]]

This item is a formula book, religious text, or spellbook that has been creased-possibly by Princess Ganjay herself-to fold up into an impossibly small shape. When folded up, the book can't be read or used, but its Bulk is reduced by 1 (a book that is 1 Bulk becomes light Bulk, and a book that is light Bulk becomes negligible in weight).

**Activate** 1 minute (Interact) You fold or unfold the Ganjay book, manipulating the cunning creases.
