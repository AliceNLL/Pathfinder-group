This tightly sealed metal container is filled with highly pressurized gas that can explode to release a powerful shockwave. A pressure bomb deals 4d4 bludgeoning damage and 4 bludgeoning splash damage. On a critical hit, the target is knocked [[Prone]].

Medium or smaller creatures who take splash damage are pushed 5 feet away from the target, and then, if the target is Large or smaller, it is pushed 5 feet away from you.

You gain a +3 item bonus to attack rolls.
