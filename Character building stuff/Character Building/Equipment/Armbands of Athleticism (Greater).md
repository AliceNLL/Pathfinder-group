Skilled awl work has imprinted images of a muscled weightlifter into these tiered leather bands, which grant you enhanced stamina and skill when performing athletic exercises.

While fastened to your upper arms, the armbands give you a +3 item bonus to Athletics checks.

In addition, whenever you use an action to Climb or Swim and you succeed at the Athletics check, add a +10-foot item bonus to the distance you move.
