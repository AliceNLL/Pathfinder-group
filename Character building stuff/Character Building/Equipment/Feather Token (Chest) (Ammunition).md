# Feather Token (Chest) (Ammunition)
![[icons-commodities-materials-feather-blue.webp|150]]

Each feather token appears to be a simple feather from some exotic bird. The feather's shaft, dipped in gold, bears a single arcane rune. Activating a feather token causes it to transform into another object, which then can be used as normal for that object. Each feather can be activated only once, with most of them permanently becoming the item in their description.

**Activate** A Strike from a ranged weapon

When you use this token, a small wooden chest appears and immediately opens. This chest can hold up to 10 Bulk worth of items. Once the chest is closed, it transforms again-this time into a key-taking all of the stored items with it. You can activate this key by spending an Interact action to turn it in an imaginary lock, which causes it to transform back into a chest with all of the items still inside. Once it has turned into a chest a second time, it forever remains a wooden chest.
