This mask is made of Darklands wasul reeds, which have been alchemically treated to enhance their air-retaining properties when submerged in water.

**Activate** 1 Interact

When you put on this mask, for the next hour, you can hold your breath for 15 rounds plus your Constitution modifier (instead of 5 rounds + your Constitution modifier) before drowning. It has no effect in non-aquatic environments that require you to hold your breath. One hour after you apply the mask, it flakes away into fiber shreds.
