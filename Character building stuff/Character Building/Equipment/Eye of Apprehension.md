**Activate** F (concentrate)

**Trigger** You are about to roll Perception for initiative but haven't rolled yet

**Requirements** You are a master in Perception

This round piece of cymophane's silky inclusion makes it look like a cat's eye. While affixed, it makes you jittery.

When you activate it, roll Perception twice and use the higher result.
