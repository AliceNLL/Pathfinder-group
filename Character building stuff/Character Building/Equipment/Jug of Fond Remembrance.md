# Jug of Fond Remembrance
![[icons-containers-kitchenware-jug-terracotta-orange.webp|150]]

This large jug always seems to contain just enough of the holder's favorite alcohol to share with a friend. As long as you're holding the jug, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Diplomacy checks. If you share a sip of the liquor from the jug with a creature, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your next Diplomacy check to [[Make an Impression]] or [[Request]] something from that creature any time within the next month.

**Activate** 1 Interact

**Frequency** once per hour

* * *

**Effect** You take a long swig on the jug and then Recall Knowledge about a creature you can see, with a +2 circumstance bonus to the check. If you fail but don't critically fail this check, you get a success instead. You're then [[Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] for 3 rounds.
