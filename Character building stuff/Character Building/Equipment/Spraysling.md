# Spraysling
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-weapon.svg|150]]

A spraysling is similar to a standard sling but with a wider cup fitted with a thin blade affixed to the cup's edges. When used to make an attack with a specially prepared packet of spray pellets, the razor slices open the packet and the weapon launches a cluster of stinging pellets.
