# Clandestine Cloak
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-worn-items-other-worn-items-clandestine-cloak.webp|150]]

When you pull up the hood of this nondescript gray cloak (an Interact action), you become drab and uninteresting, gaining a +1 item bonus to Stealth checks and to Deception checks to [[Impersonate]] a forgettable background character, such as a servant, but also taking a -1 item penalty to Diplomacy and Intimidation checks.

* * *

**Activateâ€”Cloak Identity** D (concentrate, manipulate)

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** You pull the cloak's hood up and gain the benefits of _[[Veil of Privacy]]_ for 1 hour or until you pull the hood back down, whichever comes first.
