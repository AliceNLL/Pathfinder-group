# Ready
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-runes-armor-property-runes-armor-property-runes.webp|150]]

A _ready_ rune draws component pieces of a suit of armor toward one another, making it extremely fast to get into. You can don light armor with a _ready_ rune as a single action, or medium or heavy armor with a ready rune as a 2-action activity.
