# Green Wyrmling Breath Potion
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-consumables-potions-black-dragons-breath-potion.webp|150]]

This liquid contains blood from a wyrmling green dragon. For 1 hour after you drink it, you can unleash a cloud of poison as a breath weapon. Exhaling dragon breath uses a single action. The breath weapon deals 2d6 poison damage in a 15 foot cone, and each creature in the area must attempt a DC 23 Basic fortitude save. After you use the breath weapon, you can't do so again for 1d4 rounds.
