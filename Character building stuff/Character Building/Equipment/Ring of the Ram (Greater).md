![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-worn-items-other-worn-items-ring-of-the-ram.webp|150]]

This heavy iron ring is shaped to look like the head of a ram, with curling horns.

**Activate** A or more (Interact)

**Frequency** once per minute

* * *

**Effect** A ram-shaped blast of force slams into one foe that you can see within 60 feet. The number of actions you spend to Activate this Item (from 1 to 3) determines the intensity of the force.

The blow deals 3d6 force damage per action spent and pushes the target 5 feet per action spent. The target must attempt a DC 32 fortitude save.

When you activate the ring using 3 actions, you can disperse the force into multiple magical rams, targeting all creatures in a 30 foot cone instead of one target within 60 feet.

1 3d6 force damage

2 6d6 force damage

3 9d6 force damage

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target takes half damage and is pushed half the distance.

**Failure** The target takes full damage and is pushed the full distance.

**Critical Failure** The target takes double damage and is pushed twice the distance.
