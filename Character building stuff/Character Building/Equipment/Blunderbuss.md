# Blunderbuss
![[icons-weapons-guns-gun-blunderbuss-worn-brown.webp|150]]

This weapon fires pellets from a trumpet-shaped barrel, making it an excellent choice for hunting brush fowl or dealing damage within a short, broad area. Adventuring gunslingers often carry a blunderbuss to deal with swarms of vermin and similar threats.
