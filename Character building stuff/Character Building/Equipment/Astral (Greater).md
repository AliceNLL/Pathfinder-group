![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-runes-weapon-property-runes-weapon-property-runes.webp|150]]

Astral weapons command powerful spiritual energy from the Astral Plane. This rune has the same effects as a _ghost touch_ rune, plus Strikes with it deal an extra 1d6 spirit damage. If used to attack a creature that's possessing another creature, this weapon deals no damage to the possessed creature. On a critical hit against a creature possessing another creature, the possessing creature must succeed at a DC 36 will save or be expelled and unable to possess a creature for `dice: 1d4` rounds.

Spirit damage dealt by this weapon ignores the target's spirit resistance.
