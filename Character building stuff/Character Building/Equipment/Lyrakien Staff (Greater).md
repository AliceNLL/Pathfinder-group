# Lyrakien Staff (Greater)
![[icons-weapons-staves-staff-simple.webp|150]]

A crystalline sphere, swirling with constantly shifting constellations, sits atop a _lyrakien staff_, a silver shaft that sparkles with the gentle glow of starlight. Desnans first created the staves, inspired by the music- and freedom-loving lyrakien azatas, but these staves are popular with spellcasters of all faiths who like travel, art, or the stars. While wielding a lyrakien staff, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on saving throws against incapacitation effects.
