# Whip of Compliance
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-weapons-specific-magic-weapons-whip-of-compliance.webp|150]]

The handle of this braided leather +1 striking whip is made from the hairs of a variety of rare and mythical animals. When used against an animal, the _whip of compliance_ can potentially force the target to follow your commands.

**Activate** A command

* * *

**Effect** Until the end of your current turn, any animals you Strike with the whip must attempt a DC 25 will. On a failed or critically failed saving throw, the whip casts a 4th-level _[[Suggestion]]_ spell on the animal with a base duration of 1 round, and the spell loses the linguistic trait. The course of action must still fulfill _suggestion's_ requirements.

If you can cast spells, you can expend one of your spells of 4th level or higher as a part of activating the whip; if you do so, the _suggestions_ this turn have their normal base duration.
