**Activate** 2 Interact

This toxin erratically stimulates the limbs, forcing unexpected shifts in momentum. The result resembles a gangly, lurching dance. At the start of each turn, the victim takes one or more Steps in a random direction if able. This movement is forced and doesn't count against the victim's actions for the round.

**Saving Throw** DC 30 fortitude

**Maximum Duration** 6 rounds

**Stage 1** 4d6 poison and 1 Step of forced movement (1 round)

**Stage 2** 6d6 poison, [[Clumsy 1]], and 1 Step of forced movement (1 round)

**Stage 3** 8d6 poison, [[Clumsy 1|Clumsy 2]], 2 Steps of forced movement (1 round)
