# Kortos Diamond
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-artifacts-kortos-diamond.webp|150]]

The hilt of this _+3 major striking [[Axiomatic]] [[Spell Reservoir|Spell-Storing]] longsword_ is simple and elegant. The blade itself is made of _throneglass_â€”a clear, jewellike crafting material with a razor-sharp edge, capable of absorbing psychic magic and redirecting it at the wielder's enemies. Whenever the _Kortos Diamond_ is in an area of dim or brighter light, it glows faintly, as if reflecting the light of a setting sun.

While wielding the _Kortos Diamond_, you gain a +2 item bonus on saving throws against mental effects. You can never harm yourself with the _Kortos Diamond_, even if [[Confused]].

If you ever travel farther than 100 miles from the Isle of Kortos while in possession of the _Kortos Diamond_, the sword becomes impossibly heavy; you are encumbered as long as you carry the sword and remain outside of this area. If you relinquish the _Kortos Diamond_ while away from Kortos, the sword gradually makes its way back to the isle over the course of a year.

This effect lasts for up to 1 minute.
