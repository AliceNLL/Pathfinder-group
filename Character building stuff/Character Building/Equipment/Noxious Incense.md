# Noxious Incense

**Activate** Cast a Spell

* * *

Sold only in single sticks, this foul incense comes coated with a bevy of alchemical smoke that activates in the presence of intense heat, releasing its namesake pungent odor. Adding this catalyst to a _[[Wall of Fire]]_ spell fills all squares adjacent to the wall with thick, foul smoke. Creatures in this area are [[Concealed]], and other creatures are concealed to creatures in the area. The smoke lasts for the duration of the spell. The incense can be used with a _wall of fire_ of 6th level or below.
