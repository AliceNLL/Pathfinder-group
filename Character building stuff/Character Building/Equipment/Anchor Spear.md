# Anchor Spear
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-weapons-specific-magic-weapons-anchor-spear.webp|150]]

The tip of this +2 greater striking spear is large and wickedly barbed, and the haft is inlaid with fine silver lines that run the length of the weapon. Wielded by specially trained xulgath cavalry, anchor spears are used to prevent the escape of gogiteths or other monsters capable of climbing or burrowing.

**Effect** The spear embeds itself into the creature, and the spear's haft splits along the silver lines to become a series of hooks attached to a thin but strong cable. As long as the _anchor spear_ remains embedded in the creature, any time the creature burrows or climbs, it treats normal terrain as difficult terrain and difficult terrain as greater difficult terrain. The creature can spend an Interact action to attempt a DC 32 athletics check to remove the spearhead.
