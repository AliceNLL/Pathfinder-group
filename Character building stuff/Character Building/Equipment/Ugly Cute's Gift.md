# Ugly Cute's Gift
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-weapons-spiked-gauntlet.webp|150]]

This spiky, stony fragment shed from Ugly Cute's carapace fits quite comfortably over the hand. Though a little bulkier than the typical gauntlet, it still functions as a _+1 spiked gauntlet_.

**Activate** 2 command, Interact

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** You draw upon Ugly Cute's latent spiritual energy to infuse the gauntlet with forceful power. For 1 minute, _Ugly Cute's gift_ gains the advantages of a [[Ghost Touch]] property rune and deals an additional 2 force damage on a successful Strike.
