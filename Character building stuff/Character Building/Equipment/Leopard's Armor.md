# Leopard's Armor
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-armor-specific-magic-armor-leopards-armor.webp|150]]

Made of cobalt-colored steel rings that flow down the entire length of the garment, this _+1 resilient chain mail_ includes an armored face covering. The armor is said to be based on the same armor once worn by Azure Leopard, one of Old-Mage Jatembe's magic warriors.

* * *

**Activate** 2 command, envision

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** You call upon the ferocity and grace of the leopard. The armor's rings flatten out to become a solid piece of flexible armor. You gain a +2 item bonus to Stealth checks and Intimidation checks to [[Demoralize]], but take a -2 penalty to Diplomacy and Society checks.

This lasts for 1 hour, but you can Activate the armor again to revert it back to its original form.
