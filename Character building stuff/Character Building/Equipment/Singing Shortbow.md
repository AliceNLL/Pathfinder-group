# Singing Shortbow
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-weapons-specific-magic-weapons-singing-shortbow.webp|150]]

Rather than a normal bowstring, this _+2 greater striking thundering composite shortbow_ has a string made of animal gut, much like a musical instrument's. When you shoot the bow, it releases a soft musical note: sonorous if your aim is true and discordant if your shot goes off-target.

* * *

**Activate** 2 command (auditory)

**Frequency** once per hour

* * *

**Effect** You sing, hum, or whistle a note, and your bow provides appropriate accompaniment. Make a Strike with the bow. If it hits, the bow generates a magical effect determined by the note you sung, which has the traits indicated in parentheses. This affects every creature in a 10 foot emanation from the creature you hit. As normal for an emanation, you choose whether the creature you hit is affected.

*   **Song of Soothing** (emotion, enchantment, healing, mental) Each creature regains 3d10 Hit Points and gains a +1 status bonus to saves against mental effects for 1 minute.
*   **Song of Suffering** (evocation, sonic) Each creature takes 3d10 sonic damage with a DC 31 fortitude save.
