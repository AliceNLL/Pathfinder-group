# Static Snare
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-snares-static-snare.webp|150]]

You hide insulating crystals or other material that releases a strong static charge when the first creature enters the snare's square. That creature must attempt a DC 18 reflex saving throw.

* * *

**Success** The target is unaffected.

**Failure** The target takes 1 persistent,electricity damage and takes a -1 circumstance penalty to saving throws against electricity effects for as long as the persistent electricity damage lasts.

**Critical Failure** As failure, and the target attracts nearby dirt and dust. If the target is or becomes [[Invisible]], it's merely [[Hidden]] to creatures that have sight as a precise sense. This effect lasts as long as the persistent electricity damage does.
