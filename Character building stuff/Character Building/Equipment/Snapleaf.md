# Snapleaf
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-consumables-talismans-snapleaf.webp|150]]

**Usage** affixed to armor

**Activate** R Interact

**Trigger** You begin to fall

This small, crystalline carving takes the shape of a tree leaf and attaches to armor or clothing with a simple strap.

When you activate the _snapleaf_, you gain the benefits of _[[Gentle Landing]]_ and a 2nd-level _[[Invisibility]]_ spell for 1 minute or until you stop falling, whichever comes first.
