# Flame Drake Snare
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-consumable.svg|150]]

The snare takes the form of a Tiny, drake-like clockwork toy. When a creature enters its square the snare activates, causing the drake to spit a gout of fire in a 15 foot cone{15-foot cone} in the direction from which the creature entered.

For instance, if a creature entered the square coming from the east, the cone would point east, to hit any allies behind the triggering creature. Those within the cone must succeed a DC 19 Basic reflex save or take 6d6 fire damage. After spitting its fire, the snare falls apart.
