# Winder's Ring
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-worn-items-other-worn-items-ring-of-maniacal-devices.webp|150]]

This ring contains dozens of minute, interlocking bronze gears that buzz incessantly. The ring grants you a +1 item bonus to all Crafting checks to construct or repair clockworks.

**Activate** (varies) Interact

**Effect** The _winder's ring_ extends a winding key that fits any clockwork contraption or creature, allowing you to fully wind a clockwork device or creature in half the usual time. When you activate a _winder's ring_ in this way, attempt a DC 16 flat. On a failure, the _winder's ring_ exhausts itself, and you can't activate it again until the next time you make your daily preparations.

**Activate** 1 Interact

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** The _winder's ring_ transforms into a [[Clockwork-Spy]] that doesn't require winding and obeys your spoken commands for up to 1 hour. In this form, the _winder's ring_ has the minion trait. You can use this action again to return the clockwork spy to _winder's ring_ form as long as you're adjacent to the clockwork spy. If the clockwork spy is slain, it reverts to its ring shape, and the _winder's ring_ can't be activated again until 1 week has passed.
