# Fiddle of the Maestro
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-held-items-fiddle-of-the-maestro.webp|150]]

This exquisite fiddle is perfectly carved and balanced to produce the purest sound while granting its player perfect balance and poise. It grants a +2 item bonus to Performance checks. If you're a master in Performance, while playing it you also gain a +1 status bonus to Reflex saves and a +1 item bonus to Dexterity-based skill checks. If you're legendary in Performance, the bonuses are +2.

When you [[Perform]] with the fiddle, you can choose to create a harsh and discordant note. You critically fail the Performance check, shred the strings of the fiddle, and create an 8th-level _[[Noise Blast]]_, with a 40 foot emanation around you instead of a 10 foot burst. The fiddle can't be played again until the strings are replaced at a cost of 200 gp.
