# Fighting Fan
![[icons-commodities-materials-material-feathers-violet.webp|150]]

This fan is useful for elegant dances as well as for slicing unsuspecting foes with the blades along its outer edge. If used in performances, it might be disguised as a frilly accessory, or it might be an obvious, though elegant, weapon.
