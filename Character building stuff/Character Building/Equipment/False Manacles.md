# False Manacles
![[icons-sundries-survival-cuffs-shackles-steel.webp|150]]

These manacles are nearly indistinguishable from real manacles upon inspection, but contain a hidden release that enables a wearer who knows the location of the release to free themselves with a single Interact action. An observer who examines the manacles and succeeds at a DC 20 perception check notices their false nature. On a critical success, the observer finds the location of the hidden catch as well.
