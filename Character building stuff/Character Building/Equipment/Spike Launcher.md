# Spike Launcher
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-weapon.svg|150]]

Built from the spiked tail of a manticore, a _spike launcher_ is designed to launch large, spear-like projectiles. A _spike launcher_ is a _+1 striking_ weapon. It's a distinct type of martial firearm that deals 1d8 piercing damage. It has the backstabber, fatal aim d12, and kickback traits with a range increment of 120 feet and reload 2. It uses the critical specialization of the bow weapon group, rather than the firearm critical specialization.

**Activate** 3 Interact (evocation, magical)

**Frequency** once per day

**Requirements** The _spike launcher_ is loaded

* * *

**Effect** The _spike launcher_ fires a volley of smaller spikes in a 10 foot burst centered anywhere within its range. Make a Strike with the _spike launcher_ against each creature in the area. On a success, the spike causes the creature to take a -5-foot status penalty to their Speed. On a critical success, the creature becomes [[Immobilized]] instead. In either case, the creature, or an adjacent creature, can use an Interact action to remove the spike and end the penalty or immobilized condition.

**Craft Requirements** The initial raw materials must include the tail of a manticore.
