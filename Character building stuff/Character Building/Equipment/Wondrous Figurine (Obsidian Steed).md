# Wondrous Figurine (Obsidian Steed)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-held-items-wondrous-figurine-obsidian-steed.webp|150]]

This sinister-looking black statuette resembles a horse rearing up on its hind legs.

When activated, this figurine becomes a [[Nightmare]].

It can be called upon once per week for up to 24 hours, though it won't use _[[Interplanar Teleport]]_ or its other abilities on behalf of its rider.

Although evil, it allows itself to be ridden by creatures of any alignment, although if a good creature mounts it, the rider must attempt a DC 3 flat. On a failure, the nightmare uses _[[Interplanar Teleport]]_ to take the rider to a random location in the Abyss, where it promptly returns to statue form, stranding its rider in that nightmarish place.
