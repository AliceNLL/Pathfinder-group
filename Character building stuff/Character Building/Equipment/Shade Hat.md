# Shade Hat
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-worn-items-other-worn-items-shade-hat.webp|150]]

This comfortable and stylish wide-brimmed hat magically protects you from the worst of the heat in hot areas, even when the heat doesn't come from the sun. While wearing the _shade hat_, you are protected from mild and severe heat (but not extreme heat).
