# Phoenix Necklace
![[icons-equipment-neck-pendant-faceted-silver-red.webp|150]]

This brilliant jewelry is made from fine silver interwoven with a uniquely malleable form of ruby that causes the necklace to glimmer like a flickering fire. Hao Jin created the necklaces to mitigate the potential of death during the Ruby Phoenix Tournament pre-qualifier, and she specially attuned each phoenix necklace to the silver feathers she created for the pre-qualifying round. While the silver feathers themselves aren't magical, they are required to activate the necklace's power. Each team starts with 3 feathers hidden in their headquarters; they acquire more through challenges and events. Additionally, the tournament emissary's enforcers have the ability to deliver messages to the necklace's wearer at any time by casting _[[Sending]]_, though the wearer can't respond.

* * *

**Activate** 3 command, envision

**Effect** You select any number of willing creatures you can see within 30 feet, including yourself. The selected creatures can make nonlethal attacks without taking a penalty to their attack rolls. This effect remains in place until you remove the necklace or use this activation again.

* * *

**Activate** 10 minutes (envision, Interact)

**Effect** The necklace consumes one of the attached silver feathers and casts 7th-level _[[Raise Dead]]_. Activating this ability is particularly costly and every activation requires consuming one more silver feather than the previous activation.

* * *

**Destruction** Once a phoenix necklace has 10 silver feathers attached, Hao Jin can transform the necklace into a [[Phoenix Fighting Fan]], a process which requires 3 Interact actions.
