# Humbug Pocket
![[icons-containers-bags-pouch-leather-green.webp|150]]

Fine silk lines this fashionable pocket, which is typically cinched to a belt or tailored into a piece of formal clothing. The pocket can hold no more than one item of light Bulk, plus incidental items of negligible Bulk. The pocket grants you a +2 item bonus to Society and to Stealth checks to [[Conceal an Object]] in the pocket.

The pocket can produce stationery and writing implements of high quality. When you [[Create Forgery|Create a Forgery]], you can use the pocket to produce ideal materials to make the forgery. Any materials must be able to fit through the opening of the pocket, such as a roll of parchment, an inkwell, or a loupe. Though they're excellent tools, they don't have any value if sold and disappear once their function in making a forgery is fulfilled.
