# Skeleton Key
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-held-items-skeleton-key.webp|150]]

A grinning skull tops the bow of this macabre key. This key can be used in place of thieves' toolkit when attempting to Pick a Lock, and it grants a +1 item bonus to the Thievery check.

If the _skeleton key_ becomes broken due to a critical failure on the check, it works as normal thieves' toolkit and loses its benefits until repaired.

**Activateâ€”Loosen Lock** F (manipulate)

**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** You attempt to Pick a Lock but haven't rolled yet

* * *

**Effect** The key casts _[[Knock]]_ on the lock you're trying to pick.
