# Masquerade Scarf
![[icons-equipment-neck-handkerchief-bandana-blue.webp|150]]

This delicately embroidered scarf matches with every outfit and can even complete a costume or disguise with illusions.

**Activateâ€”Masquerade** 1 minute (manipulate)

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** You arrange the scarf over your lower face, and it casts a 1st-rank _[[Illusory Disguise]]_ spell on you, which ends immediately if the scarf is removed. You can alter the scarf's appearance or make it _[[Invisible]]_ as part of the illusory disguise, but it can still be felt if touched.
