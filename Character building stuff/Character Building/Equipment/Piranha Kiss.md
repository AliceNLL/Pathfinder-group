# Piranha Kiss
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-weapons-piranha-kiss.webp|150]]

Made of a jagged blade with teeth pointing toward a leather-wrapped hilt, these weapons are particularly effective at disarming opponents. Piranha kisses were occasionally used during the Vidric Revolution, and some Firebrands carry them today. Members of the Firebrands have access to this weapon.
