# Rhinoceros Mask
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-equipment.svg|150]]

Covered with thick armor and bearing a thicker horn, this face mask grants you increased momentum. If you Stride at least 10 feet, your next melee Strike before the end of your turn ignores the Hardness of objects with a Hardness of 5 or less. If the object has more than Hardness 5, the mask grants no benefit.
