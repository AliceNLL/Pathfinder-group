# Barricade Stone (Sphere)
![[icons-commodities-gems-pearl-natural.webp|150]]

**Activate** 2 command, Interact

* * *

The ancient inhabitants of Bloodsalt crafted these magic rocks to construct defenses quickly. In its stone form, a _barricade stone_ appears to be a simple pebble with an unnaturally geometric shape. The size and shape of the stone's final form depends on the type of barricade stone.

When you activate the _barricade stone_, you drop it on the ground, throw it up to 20 feet away, or sling it using a sling weapon.

Upon landing, the stone instantly and permanently expands. The stone grows to its maximum size. While normally items with the structure trait put creatures in their area inside the structure, this effect creates solid stone, so it can't be placed in an area where there are creatures. While it's likely to take some time even with the right tools, an activated _barricade stone_ can be destroyed the same as any normal stone structure (Hardness 14, HP 56).

**Type: Sphere**

This smooth marble keeps its shape when activated, growing into a spherical boulder 10 feet in diameter. If stationary, the boulder can be pushed 5 feet with a successful DC 24 athletics save; on a failure, the creature is knocked [[Prone]]).
