# Chakri
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-weapon.svg|150]]

Similar to a chakram, chakri are too light to be wielded in melee but allow the user significantly more control over their throws. A chakri is small and light enough that up to two can be worn on each wrist; a chakri worn on the wrist is reload 0 instead of reloadâ€”.
