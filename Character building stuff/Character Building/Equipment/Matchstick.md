**Activate** A (manipulate)

An alchemical substance applied to one end of this tiny wooden stick ignites when struck against a rough surface. Creating a flame with a matchstick is much faster than creating a flame with flint and steel. You can ignite the matchstick and touch it to a flammable object as part of the same Interact action.
