# Brilliant Rapier
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-weapons-specific-magic-weapons-brilliant-rapier.webp|150]]

This _+2 brilliant greater striking rapier_ is formed entirely out of radiant energy, even more so than a usual brilliant weapon, and has left its physical form behind entirely. Instead of dealing piercing damage, it deals fire damage, and in addition to a rapier's normal weapon traits, it gains the versatile spirit or vitality trait.
