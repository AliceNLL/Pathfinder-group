# Winged
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-runes-armor-property-runes-armor-property-runes.webp|150]]

This rune is a swirling glyph on the front of the armor. A large pair of transparent, ephemeral wings floats out from the back of the armor.

**Activateâ€”Take to the Skies** 2 (concentrate, manipulate)

**Frequency** once per hour

* * *

**Effect** You trace the rune on the front of the breastplate, and the armor's ephemeral wings grow tangible, granting you a fly Speed of 25 feet or your land Speed, whichever is slower. This effect lasts for 5 minutes or until you Dismiss it. Once the effect ends, the wings disappear completely, reappearing in their ephemeral form 1 hour later
