# Enveloping Light (Greater)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-tattoos-enveloping-light.webp|150]]

This tattoo is a series of six concentric circles that show up as a soft yellow on any skin tone. The marks carry in them a protective force that bolsters your body and soul. Any time someone rolls a critical failure to Treat your Wounds, they get a failure instead.

**Activate** 2 command

**Frequency** once per day

**Effect** For 5 rounds, your entire body begins to glow, with the effects of a 4th-level _[[Light]]_ spell. At the end of each of your turns during this time, you regain 2d8 Hit Points.
