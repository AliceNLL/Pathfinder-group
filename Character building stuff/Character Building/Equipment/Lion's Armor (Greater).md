# Lion's Armor (Greater)
![[icons-equipment-chest-breastplate-layered-gold.webp|150]]

Various parts of this +3 _greater resilient half plate_ are forged into the shape of a lion's head. The golden lion heads grant you a commanding presence and seem to actively growl at your enemies, granting you a +3 item bonus to Intimidation.

The lions on the armor work in tandem with the lion on a _lion's shield_. If you critically hit with the _lion's shield_ using Lion Bite, the lions on the armor roar in support of the shield, causing the target of the shield's Strike to become [[Frightened|Frightened 1]].

**Activateâ€”Roar of the Pride** 2 (concentrate)

**Frequency** once per hour

* * *

**Effect** The lions on your armor roar, attempting to cow your enemies. Attempt a check to [[Demoralize]] each enemy within 30 feet of you. On a critical success, the target is also [[Fleeing]] for 1 round.
