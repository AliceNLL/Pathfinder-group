# Aeon Stone (Consumed)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-worn-items-other-worn-items-aeon-stone-dull-gray.webp|150]]

Over millennia, these mysterious, intricately cut gemstones have been hoarded by mystics and fanatics hoping to discover their secrets. Despite their myriad forms and functions, these stones are purportedly all fragments of crystal tools used by otherworldly entities to construct the universe in primeval times.

When you invest one of these precisely shaped crystals, the stone orbits your head instead of being worn on your body. You can stow an _aeon stone_ with an Interact action, and an orbiting stone can be snatched out of the air with a successful Disarm action against you. A stowed or removed stone remains invested, but its effects are suppressed until you return it to orbit your head again.

There are various types of _aeon stones_, each with a different appearance and magical effect. Each _aeon stone_ also gains a resonant power when slotted into a special magical item called a _wayfinder_.

* * *

A _consumed_ aeon stone is a dull lump that has lost its magical properties. It still rotates your head like any other aeon stone and can thus serve as a stylish, hand-free option for various spells that target an object.

This aeon stone has no resonant power.
