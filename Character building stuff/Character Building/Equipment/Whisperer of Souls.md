# Whisperer of Souls
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-weapons-specific-magic-weapons-glaive-of-the-artist.webp|150]]

This _+4 major striking greater brilliant keen glaive_ binds the souls of powerful creatures it slays. The soul can't be returned to life by any means while imprisoned within the glaive and can be freed only by a deed of great benevolence or selflessness. While using the glaive as a weapon, whenever you reduce a sapient creature of 18th level or higher to 0 Hit Points or roll a critical success with a Strike against such a target, the creature must attempt a DC 50 fortitude save.

* * *

**Critical Success** No additional effect.

**Success** The glaive siphons the creature's essence, rendering it [[Drained 1]]. If the creature dies from the Strike or while drained in this way, the creature's soul is bound in the glaive.

**Failure** As success, but the creature is [[Drained 1|Drained 2]].

**Critical Failure** As success, but the creature is [[Drained 1|Drained 4]].

The glaive also has the following activations.

**Activate**F envision

**Trigger** You Strike with the Whisperer of Souls

* * *

**Effect** You choose whether the Strike deals lethal or nonlethal damage. If the glaive has a reason for doing so, such as slaying a creature whose soul the glaive can absorb, it can defy your choice if you fail a DC 50 will save.

**Activate**F envision

**Trigger** You attempt an Occultism check to [[Decipher Writing]], [[Identify Magic]], [[Learn a Spell]], or [[Recall Knowledge]]

* * *

**Effect** You listen to eldritch secrets the weapon whispers, gaining a +4 item bonus to the triggering check.

**Activate**3 command, envision, Interact

**Frequency** once per week

* * *

**Effect** Attempt an Occultism check as if you cast the _[[Collective Memories]]_ ritual about a subject. If you roll a success or critical success, you can repeat what the _Whisperer of Souls_ relates to you about the subject. On a critical failure, you and the glaive are drawn into a murmuring void of cold, where your mind is assaulted by strange visions for an entire week. At the end of this time, you reappear and must attempt a DC 50 will save.

**Success** When you return, you can retrain one of your skills into a Lore skill about evil creatures or places, as if you had spent 1 week retraining.

**Failure** As success, but you are [[Stupefied|Stupefied 2]] for 1 week.

**Critical Failure** As success, but your alignment moves one step toward evil and you must retrain one of your skills into a Lore about evil creatures or places. You become obsessed with increasing your forbidden knowledge, turning to wicked forces that offer such secrets and compromising your morals further if you must.

**Destruction** If the _Whisperer of Souls_ is used to slay Shelyn's herald, it disintegrates, bringing about great evil in its wake.
