# Setup Snare
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-snares-signaling-snare.webp|150]]

This snare is designed to divert a target's movement towards another snare or hazard. You may choose to have the target attempt a Will saving throw instead of a Reflex saving throw; if you do, add the fear and mental traits plus add either the visual or auditory trait.

When a Small or larger creature enters the square, the snare Pushes the creature 5 feet and the target becomes [[Clumsy 1]] until the end of their next turn. On a critical failure the snare Pushes the target 10 feet and the target becomes [[Clumsy 1|Clumsy 2]] until the end of their next turn.
