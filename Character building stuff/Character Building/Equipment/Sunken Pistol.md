A _sunken pistol_ is imbued with the unfulfilled desires and insatiable greed of its previous wielder, a notorious pirate drowned at sea. Once a beautiful and artistically wrought weapon, a _sunken pistol_ is coated in a fine layer of dried salt and encrusted with barnacles. Each shot fired from this _+1 striking dragon mouth pistol_ is now coated in a layer of salty ectoplasm and has the effects of a ghost touch rune. You can shoot the _sunken pistol_ underwater, even when using black powder ammunition.

A _sunken pistol_ urges you to amass a horde of treasure even a dragon would be proud of. The methods used to acquire these riches matter not to the greedy pirate pistol, so long as you amass and hoard excessive wealth. Above all else, a _sunken pistol_ desires the return of its own treasure, which might rest in the wreck of its sunken ship's hold or be [[Hidden]] on a dangerous island.

In pursuit of treasure, a _sunken pistol_ offers nautical and navigation advice to you, though it refuses such aid during less lucrative ventures. If you prove a profitable partner, the _sunken pistol_ aids you in combat by Demoralizing your opponents (see the first Activation below). If you prove charitable or unwilling to retrieve its treasure, the _sunken pistol_ turns its ire on you, Demoralizing you during combat until you relent. If you repeatedly refuse the _sunken pistol_, it would be wise to not accept water breathing from it, as it might attempt to drown you to allow a more suitable wielder to acquire it from your corpse. The _sunken pistol_ can use the following activations.

**Effect** The _sunken pistol_ casts water breathing on you as a 3rd-level arcane spell. The _sunken pistol_ can Dismiss this spell, so be sure to keep the gun happy if you're relying on its good graces to breathe!
