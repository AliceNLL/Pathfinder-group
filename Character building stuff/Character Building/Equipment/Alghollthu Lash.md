# Alghollthu Lash
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-weapons-whip.webp|150]]

This fleshy _+1 striking whip_ is obviously crafted from the tentacle of some fearsome beast, likely an alghollthu, and constantly drips slime.

**Activate** 1 command

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** The next creature you successfully Strike with this weapon is exposed to alghollthu slime.

**Alghollthu Slime** (curse, occult)

**Saving Throw** DC 25 fortitude

**Stage 1** no ill effect (1 round)

**Stage 2** the victim's skin softens, making the creature [[Drained 1]] (1 round)

**Stage 3** the victim's skin transforms into a clear, slimy membrane, making it [[Drained 1|Drained 2]] until the curse ends; every hour this membrane remains dry, the creature's drained condition increases by 1 (permanent). A remove disease spell can counteract this curse, but immunity to disease offers no protection against it.

* * *

**Craft Requirements** The initial raw materials must include a tentacle from an alghollthu.
