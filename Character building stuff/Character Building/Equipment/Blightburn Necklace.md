# Blightburn Necklace
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-worn-items-other-worn-items-blightburn-necklace.webp|150]]

This heavy iron necklace is decorated with tiny gems that resemble the stars in the ceiling high above the Vault of the Black Desert. While you have invested this item, you cannot contract blightburn sickness. It doesn't cure blightburn sickness if you already have it, but the disease's stage can't progress while you wear it.
