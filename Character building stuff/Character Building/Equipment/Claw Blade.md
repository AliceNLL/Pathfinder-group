# Claw Blade
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-weapons-claw-blade.webp|150]]

The three parallel blades of this handheld weapon extend between the fingers to resemble the natural claws of the amurruns who created them, providing a way for those catfolk without suitable natural claws to share the fighting customs of their kin.
