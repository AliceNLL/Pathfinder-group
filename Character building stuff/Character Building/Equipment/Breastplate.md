# Breastplate
![[icons-equipment-chest-breastplate-collared-steel.webp|150]]

Though referred to as a breastplate, this type of armor consists of several pieces of plate or [[Half Plate]] armor that protect the torso, chest, neck, and sometimes the hips and lower legs. It strategically grants some of the protection of plate while allowing greater flexibility and speed.
