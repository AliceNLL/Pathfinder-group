An _olivine pendeloque aeon stone_ imparts the calmness of still earth and a solidity of thought, granting you a +2 item bonus to saving throws against effects that cause the [[Confused]], [[Frightened]], or [[Stupefied]] conditions.

**Activate—Still Earth** R (concentrate)

**Frequency** once per hour

**Trigger** You become confused, frightened, or stupefied

* * *

**Effect** The stone suppresses the triggering effect for 1 minute, but the calming urges impose a –1 status penalty to your attack rolls.
