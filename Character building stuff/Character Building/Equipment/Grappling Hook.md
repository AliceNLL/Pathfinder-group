# Grappling Hook
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-adventuring-gear-grapling-hook.webp|150]]

You can throw a grappling hook with a rope tied to it to make a climb easier. To anchor a grappling hook, make a ranged attack roll using your simple weapon proficiency against a DC depending on the target, typically at least DC 20. This attack has the secret trait. On a success, your hook has a firm hold, but on a critical failure, the hook seems like it will hold but actually falls when you're partway up
