# Trackless
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-equipment.svg|150]]

Trackless runes are common among hunters and trappers, as well as thieves and anyone [[Fleeing]] pursuit. While wearing trackless footwear, you have a +4 item bonus to the DC to track you. However, this bonus doesn't stack with the status bonus from _[[Vanishing Tracks]]_.
