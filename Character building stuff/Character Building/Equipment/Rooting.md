# Rooting
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-runes-weapon-property-runes-weapon-property-runes.webp|150]]

Small roots grow along the surface of the weapon, clinging tightly to its contours. On a critical hit with the weapon, roots grow from the target. It's [[Immobilized]] for 1 round ([[Escape]] DC 23) and [[Clumsy 1]] for as long as the immobilization lasts.
