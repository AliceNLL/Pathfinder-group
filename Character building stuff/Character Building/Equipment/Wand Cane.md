# Wand Cane
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-equipment.svg|150]]

Though it appears to be a basic cane, the inner workings of the _wand cane_ are an intricate network of lenses and magical circuits, with a slot at the top to insert a wand. The _wand cane_ then spends 1 minute attuning to the wand, after which the wand can be used through the cane.
