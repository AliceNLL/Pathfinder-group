# Star Grenade (Major)

**Activate** 1 Strike

* * *

These unusual gunpowder bombs, typically marked with a symbol of a four-pointed star on their outer surface, explode outward in the shape of a cross whenever they Strike a target. When you throw a star grenade, arrange two perpendicular 25 foot line{25-foot lines} over the target, both centered on the target and moving straight through the target, not diagonally. Creatures other than the target within these two lines take splash damage (typically 8 squares take splash damage for a Medium creature). Any effect that alters or adjusts the splash area's shape or size, like the alchemist feat Expanded Splash, doesn't apply to star grenades.

You gain a +3 item bonus to attack rolls. The bomb deals 4d8 fire damage and 4 splash Damage.
