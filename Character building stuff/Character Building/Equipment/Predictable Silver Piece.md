# Predictable Silver Piece
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-held-items-predictable-silver-piece.webp|150]]

This seemingly unremarkable, weathered silver coin bears the bust of an unnamed monarch on the face and a majestic bird on the tail. You can toss the coin without activating it, in which case it follows the normal laws of probability.

**Activate** 1 Interact

* * *

**Effect** You rub your thumb on one side of the coin with the intent of slightly tweaking the strands of fate, then flip the coin into the air in a coin toss. No matter how the toss is resolved- letting the coin fall to the ground, slapping it down on the back of your hand, or catching it on your open palm-it always lands with the side you rubbed face up.
