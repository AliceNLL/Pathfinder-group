# Brine Dragon Scale
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-consumables-other-consumables-bubbling-scale.webp|150]]

**Usage** affixed to a melee weapon

**Activate** R (concentrate)

**Prerequisites** You're an expert with the affixed weapon

**Trigger** A creature in reach of the weapon takes an action with the concentrate trait.

Brine dragons are known to distract their foes at just the right moment, and this blue-green scale appears to have come from one of these creatures. When you activate the scale, it cracks open and releases a spray of caustic saltwater at the triggering creature. The creature takes 2d8 acid damage with a DC 24 Basic reflex save. If the creature critically fails at its save, its concentration is brokenâ€”the triggering action is disrupted.
