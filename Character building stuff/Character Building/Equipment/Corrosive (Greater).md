# Corrosive (Greater)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-runes-weapon-property-runes-weapon-property-runes.webp|150]]

Acid sizzles across the surface of the weapon. When you hit with the weapon, add 1d6 acid damage to the damage dealt. In addition, on a critical hit, the target's armor (if any) takes 6d6 acid damage (before applying Hardness); if the target has a shield raised, the shield takes this damage instead.

The acid damage dealt by this weapon ignores the target's acid resistance.
