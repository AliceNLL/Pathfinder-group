# Falconsight Eye
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-equipment.svg|150]]

This prosthetic eye resembles that of a bird of prey. Along with the abilities of the _magical prosthetic eye_, it allows you to strike foes at greater range and with impressive accuracy.

**Activate**1 envision

**Frequency** once per hour

* * *

**Effect** You become keenly aware of your foes, even those seemingly out of reach. For 1 minute, you can close your eyes as a free action to see through a ranged weapon you're wielding, which reduces the penalty for firing into your weapon's second range increment from â€“2 to 0. This effect doesn't negate the [[Blinded]] condition.
