**Activate** A Strike

* * *

This flask is filled with a murky purple gas that briefly interferes with normal brain activity. A dread ampoule deals 1d6 mental damage and 1 mental splash damage.

On a hit, the target becomes [[Frightened|Frightened 1]], or [[Frightened|Frightened 2]] on a critical hit. Many types also grant an item bonus to attack rolls.
