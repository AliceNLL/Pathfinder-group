![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-worn-items-other-worn-items-choker-of-elocution.webp|150]]

This platinum choker bears characters from a language's alphabet, and it gives knowledge of that language and the associated culture's customs.

You gain a +1 item bonus to Society checks and the ability to understand, speak, and write the chosen language.

Your excellent elocution reduces the DC of the flat check to perform an auditory action while deafened from 5 to 3.

**Craft Requirements** You know the language or languages the choker grants.
