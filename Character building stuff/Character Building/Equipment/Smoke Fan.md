When you Activate a smoke fan, it creates a cloud of colored smoke. The creator chooses the smoke's color when creating the smoke fan. Creatures within the smoke's area are concealed, and all other creatures are concealed to them. The smoke lasts for 1 minute or until dissipated by a strong wind.

The smoke fills a 5 foot burst{5-foot radius}.
