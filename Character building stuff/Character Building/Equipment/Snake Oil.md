# Snake Oil

**Activate** A (manipulate)

* * *

You can apply snake oil onto a wound or other outward symptom of an affliction or condition (such as sores from a disease or discoloration from a poison). For the next hour, the symptom disappears and the wounded or afflicted creature doesn't feel as if it still has the wound or affliction, though all effects remain. A creature can uncover the ruse by succeeding at a DC 17 perception check, but only if it uses a Seek action to specifically examine the snake oil's effects.
