# Ghost Touch
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-runes-weapon-property-runes-weapon-property-runes.webp|150]]

A weapon etched with this rune can harm creatures without physical form. A _ghost touch_ weapon is particularly effective against incorporeal creatures, which almost always have a specific vulnerability to _ghost touch_ weapons.

Incorporeal creatures can touch, hold, and wield _ghost touch_ weapons (unlike most physical objects).
