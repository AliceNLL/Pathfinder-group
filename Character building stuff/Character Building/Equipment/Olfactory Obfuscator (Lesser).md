This frothing fluid causes the drinker's body to exude trace odor absorbing oils. For 10 minutes after drinking this elixir, your scent is nearly unnoticeable.

Creatures with imprecise scent don't detect you with that sense unless they [[Seek]] for you, and you are concealed from creatures that perceive you with precise scent. You gain a +4 item bonus against attempts to Seek you by creatures using only scent-based senses; if they use any other senses as well, the bonus doesn't apply.
