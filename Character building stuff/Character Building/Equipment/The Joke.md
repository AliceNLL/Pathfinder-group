# The Joke
![[icons-sundries-gaming-playing-cards-grey.webp|150]]

**Suit** Books (Int)

**Alignment** chaotic good

* * *

_The Joke_ represents solving a problem not with strength, but with cleverness or artifice. As long as you have _The Joke_ invested, you can attempt an appropriate Lore check instead of an Athletics check made to [[Climb]], [[Force Open]], [[Grapple]], [[High Jump]], [[Long Jump]], or [[Swim]]. For example, you could make a Mountain Lore check to climb a cliff in the mountains, or Sailing Lore check to climb the rigging on a ship.

**Activate** 2 envision, Interact

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** You perform a quick but amusing card trick with The Joke meant to distract others. You cast _[[Laughing Fit]]_ on up to 10 creatures in range of the spell. The level of the spell is one-half your level rounded down (minimum 6th level), and the save DC is your class DC (DC resolve will).
