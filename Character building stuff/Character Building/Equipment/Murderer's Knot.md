# Murderer's Knot
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-consumables-talismans-murderers-knot.webp|150]]

**Activate** F (concentrate)

**Trigger** You damage an off-guard creature with a Strike using the Affixed weapon

* * *

This black strand of leather is tied to look like a peace knot when the weapon is stowed, but it doesn't hamper drawing the weapon. When you activate the knot, the creature you damaged takes 1d6 bleed and is off-guard until the bleed ends.

If you have the Twist the Knife feat, the talisman instead deals persistent bleed damage equal to your sneak attack damage.
