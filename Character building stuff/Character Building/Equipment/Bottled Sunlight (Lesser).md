# Bottled Sunlight (Lesser)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-alchemical-items-alchemical-bombs-bottled-sunlight.webp|150]]

**Activate** 1 Interact

This mirrored bottle contains various chemicals dissolved in two immiscible solvents. Shaking the bottle induces chemical reactions that cause it to glow. For 1 hour, the bottle sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius (and dim light to the next 40 feet).

During this hour, it can be thrown like a bomb. This requires a single action to Activate with a Strike, like other bombs, and deals the damage below. If it's not thrown within an hour of the first activation, it defuses harmlessly and is consumed.

The bomb deals 1d4 vitality damage and 1 vitality splash damage, as well as 1d4 additional fire damage. As normal, vitality damage harms only undead and other creatures with void healing. Undead with a particular vulnerability to sunlight (such as vampires or wraiths) take the maximum amount of vitality damage from bottled sunlight (4 vitality instead of 1d4). For any ability that depends on the number of weapon dice bottled sunlight has, count only the vitality damage dice.
