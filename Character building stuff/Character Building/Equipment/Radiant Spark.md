# Radiant Spark
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-held-items-radiant-spark.webp|150]]

This shining prism is bound within a golden frame. The bright glow within the artifact is the gleaming essence of celestials bound within it in ancient times. Each activation consumes a bit of this celestial energy, projecting the screams of the celestials into your mind.

While holding the Radiant Spark, you gain a +2 item bonus to saving throws against divine spells and effects and you are aware of its powers.

If you are good, while holding the Radiant Spark, you are [[Sickened 1|Sickened 3]] and can't recover from this condition.

**Destruction** An archfiend or evil demigod must willingly swap their essence with that of a celestial dominated or bound by the artifact, then critically fail the saving throw against having their essence consumed. This permanently destroys both the artifact and the fiend or demigod.
