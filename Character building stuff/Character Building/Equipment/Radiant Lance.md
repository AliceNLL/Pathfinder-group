![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-weapons-specific-magic-weapons-radiant-lance.webp|150]]

When wielded in battle, these silver lances blaze with light. A _radiant lance_ is a _+2 greater striking [[Holy]] [[Flaming]] silver lance_.

* * *

When wielded in battle, the _radiant lance_ sheds bright light in a 60-foot radius.

* * *

On a hit against an undead creature that is specifically vulnerable to sunlight, the lance bursts with a brilliant flash of light, and that undead must attempt a DC 35 fortitude save. If the attack was a critical hit, the undead uses an outcome one degree of success worse than the result of its saving throw.

**Success** The undead is unaffected.

**Failure** The undead is [[Slowed]] for 1 round.

**Critical Failure** The undead is slowed 1 for 1 minute.

* * *

**Activate** D command, Interact

**Frequency** once per day

**Effect** You point the lance at a foe and call out, firing a beam with the effects of a 7th-level _[[Holy Light]]_.
