# Spy Staff (Major)
![[icons-weapons-staves-staff-simple.webp|150]]

In its normal form, a _spy staff_ is a slim rod of burnished wood with subtle etchings of eyes upon its sides. The first to develop the spy staff were agents of Andoran's Twilight Talons, but such staves have spread to espionage agencies throughout the Inner Sea region and beyond.
