When activated, the reservoir of alchemical reagents in elemental ammunition atomizes on impact, dealing 3d4 persistent,damageType acid, cold, electricity, fire, or poison damage to the target and 3 splash damage in addition to the damage the attack normally deals. Each damage type requires a different formula, and the ammunition gains a trait matching the damage type.
