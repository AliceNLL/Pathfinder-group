# Spike Snare
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-snares-spike-snare.webp|150]]

This basic snare consists of hidden spikes that rely on a creature's momentum to lacerate or potentially impale it as it enters the snare's square, dealing 2d8 piercing damage. The creature must attempt a DC 17 Basic reflex saving throw.
