# Aluum Charm
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-worn-items-other-worn-items-aluum-charm.webp|150]]

This ornate pendant of brass is adorned with a vibrant blue gemstone. An _aluum charm_ grants control over a particular aluum and lesser influence over other such constructs. As long as you wear an aluum's linked _aluum charm_, that aluum follows your verbal commands, including somewhat nuanced orders like "subdue this target" or "strike anyone wearing a blue robe."

**Activate** D command

**Frequency** once per round

**Effect** The charm grants you control over an aluum you can see within 60 feet, with a level equal to or lower than the charm. This has the effect of _[[Dominate]]_ and allows a DC 28 will save. If the aluum is currently under the control of someone wearing its linked charm, it gets a result on its saving throw one degree higher than what it rolled.

You can control only one aluum at a time using this activation, and controlling a new aluum ends the effect for one you had previously affected.
