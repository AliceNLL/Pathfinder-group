# Bewitching Bloom (Amaranth)
![[icons-magic-symbols-arrowhead-green.webp|150]]

While dormant, this tattoo appears to be a simple flower bud, but when activated the flower swiftly blossoms, remaining that way until the next time you make your daily preparations. These blooms are colorful, elegant representations of amaranth flowers.

**Activate**2 envision

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** Choose a willing ally you can see within 30 feet. The ally feels impervious, immortal. The next time they would take damage from a hazard, an enemy's attack, or an effect created by an enemy, that damage can't reduce the ally below 1 HP. This benefit ends if unused before the start of your next turn.
