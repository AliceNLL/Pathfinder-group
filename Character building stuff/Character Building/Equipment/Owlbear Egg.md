# Owlbear Egg
![[icons-consumables-eggs-egg-speckled-tan.webp|150]]

**Activate** 2 Interact

Not only are owlbear eggs delicious when boiled, but when infused with a mix of alchemical reagents, they also make you emit a long screech much like an owlbear's. All creatures in a 30 foot emanation must attempt a DC 23 will save. Regardless of the result, creatures in the area are temporarily immune to this screech for 1 minute.

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Failure** The creature is [[Frightened|Frightened 2]].

**Critical Failure** The creature is [[Frightened|Frightened 3]] and [[Fleeing]] for 1 round.
