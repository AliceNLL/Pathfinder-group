# Impenetrable Scale
![[icons-equipment-chest-breastplate-banded-steel.webp|150]]

Made of overlapping, lustrous black scales of standard-grade adamantine, this +2 _greater resilient [[Fortification]] adamantine scale mail_ seems to momentarily thicken at the point of impact when hit.

Whenever the armor's _fortification_ rune successfully turns a significant foe's critical hit into a normal hit, one of the scales on the armor turns violet. You gain resistance to physical damage equal to the number of violet scales, to a maximum of 8.

At dawn each day, all the violet scales return to normal.

**Craft Requirements** The initial raw materials must include 1,600 gp of adamantine.
