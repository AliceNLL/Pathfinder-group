# Doctrine of Blissful Eternity
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-equipment.svg|150]]

The bones of small animals decorate the cover of this tome, creating a pattern that resembles a gross perversion of Pharasma's holy symbol.

**Activate** R command

**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** An undead minion you summoned or created using a spell prepared from this grimoire takes damage that would bring it to 0 Hit Points

* * *

**Effect** You call out and demand the undead to remain, reaching out with tendrils of void energy that preserves your minion so it might continue to serve you. Expend a spell slot in which you've prepared a _[[Harm]]_ spell to restore 1d8 Hit Points to your undead minion per level of the expended spell slot, before applying the damage. If this prevents the minion from being reduced to 0 Hit Points, it isn't destroyed.
