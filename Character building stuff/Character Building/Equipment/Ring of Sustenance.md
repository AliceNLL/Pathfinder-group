# Ring of Sustenance
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-worn-items-other-worn-items-ring-of-sustenance.webp|150]]

This polished wooden ring constantly refreshes your body and mind. You don't need to eat or drink while wearing it, and you need only 2 hours of sleep per day to gain the benefits of 8 hours of sleep. A _ring of sustenance_ doesn't function until it's been worn and invested continuously for a week. Removing it resets this interval.
