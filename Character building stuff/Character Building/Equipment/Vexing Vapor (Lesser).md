![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-alchemical-items-alchemical-bombs-vexing-vapor.webp|150]]

**Activate** 1 Strike

* * *

This flask contains a fine red powder made from toxic berries. A lesser vexing vapor bomb deals 1d6 mental damage and 1 mental splash damage. On a hit, the target must succeed at a DC 5 flat check before taking actions with the concentrate trait. This lasts until the end of its next turn (1 minute on a critical hit).
