# Worm Vial
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-consumable.svg|150]]

**Activate** 2 Interact

Opening this vial unleashes its destructive contents: a reconstituted Gargantuan purple worm. The worm has two functions; choose which one to use when you Activate the item.

**Burrow** The worm Burrows up to 80 feet, leaving a tunnel behind it. It can burrow through solid stone, but if it does so it burrows 40 feet instead of 80 feet.

**Eat** The worm attempts to swallow a creature, crush it in its insides, then spit the creature out. The target must be within 15 feet, and it attempts a DC 30 reflex save. If it fails, it takes 3d6+9 bludgeoning (doubled on a critical failure). The worm then spits the creature out to any empty space on the ground within 30 feet, causing the creature to take damage from a 20-foot fall.

**Craft Requirements** Supply the corpse of a purple worm.
