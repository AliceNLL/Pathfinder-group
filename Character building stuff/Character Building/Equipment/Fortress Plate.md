# Fortress Plate
![[icons-equipment-chest-breastplate-layered-gilded-black.webp|150]]

Dwarves of Dongun Hold developed fortress plate, which is still popular in Alkenstar and Dongun Hold. A trained wearer can adjust the articulated armor's overlapping layers of plates and panels to provide protection from missiles.
