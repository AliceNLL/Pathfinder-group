This specialized version of a bag of holding appears to be a plain, leather bag that opens at the top, with a thin leather cord attached to cinch the sack closed. The sack's magic allows you to access either its mundane space or an extradimensional pocket. The mundane space inside the sack always holds 5 Bulk. The pocket has a capacity of 50 bulk. Anyone searching the bag can notice a thin, magical seam indicating the existence of the extradimensional space with a successful DC 37 perception check.
