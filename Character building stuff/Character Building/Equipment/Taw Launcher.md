# Taw Launcher
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-weapons-taw-launcher.webp|150]]

Designed by conrasu warriors, this complex device is a crossbow and fires small wooden bullets known as taws. A system of blades within the launcher can rapidly reshape a taw as it's loaded, allowing the launcher to fire taws of different shapes, such as fl√©chettes.
