# Thousand-Pains Fulu (Blade)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-consumables-fulus-fulu-fancy.webp|150]]

**Duration** 1 minute

Created by a chirurgeon who threw away morality in search of endless life, a _thousand-pains fulu_ blocks the natural flow of elements in the body. A creature to which the fulu is affixed must attempt a DC 23 Basic fortitude. Failure or critical failure primes the target for persistent damage triggered by a specific condition that must be met within the fulu's duration.

This red fulu feels rigid, its edges sharp, and looking at it makes you feel feverish. The fulu deals 5d6 slashing as meridians burst and cut through flesh. On a failure or critical failure, if the target fails to take an action with the manipulate or move trait on each of its turns, it takes 1d6 persistent,slashing.
