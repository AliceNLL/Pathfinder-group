# Disintegration Bolt
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-consumables-ammunition-disintegration-bolt.webp|150]]

The shaft of this bolt is scorched and blackened, and handling it coats your fingers with a fine black powder. When an activated _disintegration bolt_ hits a target, it is subject to a _[[Disintegrate]]_ spell requiring a DC 34 fortitude save. As with the spell, a critical hit on the attack roll causes the target's saving throw outcome to be one degree worse.

**Activate** A Interact

**Craft Requirements** Supply one casting of _disintegrate_.
