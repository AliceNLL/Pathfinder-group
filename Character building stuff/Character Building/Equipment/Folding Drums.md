# Folding Drums
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-held-items-folding_drums.webp|150]]

You can unfold this [[Musical Instrument (Virtuoso heavy)|Musical Instrument (virtuoso percussion instrument)]] into a hand drum (1 Bulk), a marching drum set with a shoulder harness and back brace (3 Bulk), or a large standing drum set with a built-in stool (16 Bulk). Changing the folding drum's size is a 3-action Interact activity, and the drums must have sufficient open space to accommodate their new size.

* * *

**Activate** 1 Interact (concentrate)

**Frequency** once per hour

* * *

**Effect** You play a pounding rhythm on the drum. If the next action you use is to cast a composition cantrip that has an emanation, increase the area of the emanation by 30 feet.
