# Healer's Toolkit
![[icons-containers-bags-pouch-gold-green.webp|150]]

This kit of bandages, herbs, and suturing tools is necessary for Medicine checks to [[Administer First Aid]], [[Treat Disease]], [[Treat Poison]], or [[Treat Wounds]]. If you wear your healer's toolkit, you can draw and replace it as part of the action that uses it.
