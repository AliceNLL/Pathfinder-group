# Disguise Kit (Replacement Cosmetics)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-adventuring-gear-disguisekit-cosmetics.webp|150]]

This small wooden box contains cosmetics, false facial hair, spirit gum, and a few simple wigs. You usually need a disguise kit to set up a disguise in order to Impersonate someone using the Deception skill. If you've crafted a large number of disguises, you can replenish your cosmetics supply with replacement cosmetics suitable for the type of your disguise kit.
