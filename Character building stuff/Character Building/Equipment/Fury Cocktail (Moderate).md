A fury cocktail is a fortifying ginger beer spiked with rum and a mixer. It's rumored to have originated from a barbarian-themed festival in a popular mead hall specializing in alchemical beverages.

**Benefit** You gain a +3 item bonus to melee attack rolls and an additional effect depending on the additive chosen when the brew is created. The effects last 1 hour.

*   **Animalistic** Lemon juice and powdered claws or talons are added to the cocktail. You gain an unarmed attack in the brawling group of your choice between a jaws attack that deals 1d6 piercing or a claw attack that has the agile trait and deals 1d4 slashing.
