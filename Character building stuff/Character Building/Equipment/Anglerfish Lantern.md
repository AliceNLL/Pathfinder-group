# Anglerfish Lantern
![[icons-sundries-lights-lantern-bullseye-signal-copper.webp|150]]

This [[Lantern (Bull's Eye)|bull's-eye lantern]] is either stylized after an anglerfish or made from the taxidermy of one. While it can be lit as usual, the _anglerfish lantern_ automatically shines when submerged in water.

**Activate—Mesmerizing Lights** 2 (concentrate, manipulate)

**Frequency** once per hour

**Effect** All creatures within the bright light of the _anglerfish lantern_ must succeed at a DC 19 will save or be [[Fascinated]] by the light for 1 round (1 minute on a critical failure). The fascination ends if the light is extinguished. Aquatic animals and creatures with the water trait take a –2 circumstance penalty to this check. Regardless of the result, the creature then becomes immune to this effect for the next 24 hours.
