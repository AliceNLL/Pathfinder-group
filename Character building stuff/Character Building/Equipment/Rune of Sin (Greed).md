# Rune of Sin (Greed)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-tattoos-rune-of-sin.webp|150]]

This jagged glyph, the greed Thassilonian rune of sin, reacts to transmutation magic. When you Cast a transmutation Spell, you gain resistance 5 to damage from spells until the start of your next turn. This resistance is increased to 7 against transmutation spells.
