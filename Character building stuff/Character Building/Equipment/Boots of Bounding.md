# Boots of Bounding
![[icons-equipment-feet-boots-leather-engraved-brown.webp|150]]

The springy soles of these sturdy leather boots cushion your feet and make each step lighter. These boots give you a +5-foot item bonus to your Speed and a +2 item bonus to Athletics checks to High Jump and Long Jump.

In addition, when you use the Leap action, you can move 5 feet further if jumping horizontally or 3 feet higher if jumping vertically.
