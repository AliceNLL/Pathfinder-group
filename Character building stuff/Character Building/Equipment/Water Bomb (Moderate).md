# Water Bomb (Moderate)
![[icons-sundries-survival-waterskin-leather-brown.webp|150]]

**Activate** 1 Strike

* * *

This bladder of water explodes when put under pressure or upon being punctured, dealing minimal damage, neutralizing acids, and dousing flames. You gain a +1 item bonus to attack rolls. The bomb deals 2 nonlethal bludgeoning splash damage. On a hit, if the target is suffering from [[Persistent Damage|Persistent Acid or Persistent Fire Damage]], it can attempt a flat check to end that persistent damage immediately. As this is particularly effective assistance, the DC of the flat check is reduced from 15 to 10 for this check. On a hit against an unattended, non-magical fire, the bomb extinguishes the fire, or extinguishes one square of fire for a larger fire.
