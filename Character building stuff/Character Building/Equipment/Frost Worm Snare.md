# Frost Worm Snare
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-consumable.svg|150]]

The snare takes the form of a Tiny frost worm clockwork toy. When a creature enters its square, the snare activates, causing the worm to let loose a 30 foot line{30-foot line} of frost in the direction from which the creature entered the square. For instance, if a creature entered the square coming from the south, the worm would shoot the line south, to hit any allies of the triggering creature. Those within the line must succeed a DC 25 Basic reflex save or take 10d6 cold{10d6 cold damage}. After spitting its frost, the snare falls apart.
