# Grappling Gun (Clockwork)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-held-items-grappling-gun.webp|150]]

This wooden, pistol-like device features a large reel coiled with 100 feet of thin metal cord and can fire a grappling hook up to 100 feet. To reload the grappling gun, you must manually recoil the cord by turning the reel's crank, and then lock in the grappling hook. Reloading a grappling gun takes 1 minute.

Clockwork controls the reel on this grappling gun, reeling the grappling hook back in when you pull a lever. Reloading a clockwork grappling gun takes three Interact actions.
