# Forge Warden
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-shields-specific-shields-forge-warden.webp|150]]

The religious symbol of Torag, the forge god-an ornate hammer of dwarven construction-adorns the face of this _lesser reinforcing steel shield_ (Hardness 8, HP 72, BT 36). The shield is a religious symbol of Torag.

You and any adjacent allies have fire resistance 5 while you have the shield raised. When used for a Shield Block, the _forge warden_ rings out like the hammer strike of a blacksmith, and the symbol glows as if lit by the fires of a furnace.
