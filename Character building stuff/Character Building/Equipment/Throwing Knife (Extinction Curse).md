# Throwing Knife (Extinction Curse)
![[icons-weapons-thrown-dagger-ringed-steel.webp|150]]

This light knife is optimally balanced to be thrown accurately at a greater distance than a common dagger. While this comes at the cost of a significant cutting edge, the difference is worth it for characters focused on thrown weapons.
