# Thawing Candle
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-consumables-other-consumables-candle-of-revealing.webp|150]]

**Activate** 1 (manipulate)

This stubby, black candle has a wick made of a type of flammable bronze that can be found only on the Plane of Fire. You activate the candle by lighting it, which enables creatures within 10 foot emanation{10 feet} of the candle to ignore the cold while within range. Creatures in the area gain cold resistance 10. In addition, a creature taking persistent cold damage that is in or enters the area can immediately attempt a DC 15 flat to end the persistent damage. A given creature can gain this flat check only once from a single _thawing candle_. Once lit, the candle burns for 10 minutes. If extinguished, it can't be relit.
