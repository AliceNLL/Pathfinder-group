# Ice Slick Snare
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-consumable.svg|150]]

Using a [[Frost Vial (Moderate)]] as a catalyst, this snare spills out over the ground when triggered to create a slippery patch of ice on the ground. When a creature triggers this snare, it takes 2d6 cold damage and must attempt a DC 22 reflex saving throw.
