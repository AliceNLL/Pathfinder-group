# Trident of Lightning
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-consumables-other-consumables-javelin-of-lightning.webp|150]]

**Activate** D (concentrate, manipulate)

* * *

This item looks like a normal trident carved with Gozren motifs. If thrown without being activated, it wobbles in the air and fails to strike true.

When you Activate the trident, the carvings crackle with electricity. You then hurl the trident. It shatters immediately after leaving your hand and unleashes its magic as a 4th-rank _[[Lightning Bolt]]_ originating from your space.

The bolt deals 5d12 electricity damage and has a DC 25 Basic reflex save.

* * *

**Craft Requirements** Supply a casting of _lightning bolt_ (4th rank).
