# Diving Suit
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-worn-items-other-worn-items-diving-suit.webp|150]]

Diving suits are bulky, waterproofed leather outfits with copper helmets, worn by divers and underwater salvagers. The suit grants a +1 item bonus to Swim checks made underwater, and the helmet features tubes for connecting _[[Bottled Air]]_. When connected to a diving suit, _bottled air_ doesn't need to be held and can be used to breathe as a free action. If you wear armor over a diving suit, you become [[Clumsy 1]] until you remove the diving suit.
