These savory breaded snacks stuffed with cheese, peppers, and "secret ingredients" of draconic or demonic origin are often offered alongside a challenge-complete a full portion and get a free drink. For 1 hour after consuming follypops, your stomach gurgles and rumbles with magical potential. During this time, you can unleash magic in the area up to three times as a single action, which has the concentrate trait, with an area and damage determined by the type of pop; the third time you use this magic, the effects of your _follypops_ end. All creatures within the area must attempt a DC 27 basic saving throw each time you unleash magic, as noted by the type of pop.

**Type** hotpops

You begin to sweat profusely after consuming the serving. When you unleash magic, you breathe out a blast of fire in a 15 foot cone. Creatures in the cone take 1d6 fire damage with the final blast. The creatures must attempt a DC 27 reflex for each blast.

**Type** rotters

Your breath smells of rotting garbage after you consume the serving. When you unleash magic, you exhale a noxious breath in a 15 foot cone. Creatures in the cone take 1d6 poison damage with the final breath. The creatures must attempt a DC 27 fortitude for each breath.

**Type** sizzlers

Your skin crawls and your hair stands on end after consuming the serving. When you unleash magic, you release a bolt of lightning from your hand that travels in a 30 foot line. The first bolt deals 1d6 electricity damage. The targeted creatures must attempt a DC 27 reflex for each bolt.
