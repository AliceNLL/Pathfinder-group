# Avalanche Boots
![[icons-equipment-feet-boots-leather-banded-furred.webp|150]]

While the insides of these boots are comfortable, fur-lined leather, the outsides are a jumble of slate plates, giving the impression of a rockslide. You gain a +3 item bonus to Athletics checks and a +2 circumstance bonus to [[Force Open]] and [[Shove]]. When you invest the boots, you either increase your Strength score by 2 or increase it to 18, whichever is higher.

* * *

**Activate** F envision

**Frequency** once per hour

**Trigger** You succeed or critically succeed with a Shove

**Effect** If the Shove was a success, you push your opponent up to 10 feet instead of 5 feet. If the Shove was a critical success, you push your opponent up to 20 feet, and you can then choose to knock them [[Prone]].
