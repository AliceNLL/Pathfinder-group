![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-consumables-potions-potion-of-cold-retalliation.webp|150]]

**Activate** 1 Interact

For 1 minute after drinking a potion of cold retaliation, you glow with a faint aura of cold energy, and a creature that touches you (such as by making an unarmed attack or using a spell with a range of touch against you) or is adjacent to you and hits you with a melee weapon strike takes cold damage.

The aura deals 2d4 cold damage.
