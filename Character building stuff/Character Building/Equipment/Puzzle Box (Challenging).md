![[icons-containers-chest-chest-reinforced-box-brown.webp|150]]

A puzzle box features moving parts, locking mechanisms, and other components designed to confound the user. Solving a puzzle box typically requires three successful DC 25 Games Lore or DC 25 thievery checks to Open a Lock, though puzzle boxes come in countless configurations and themes, and the GM can determine which skills are appropriate.
