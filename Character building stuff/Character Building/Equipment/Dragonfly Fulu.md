# Dragonfly Fulu
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-consumables-fulus-fulu-modest.webp|150]]

**Activate** f envision

**Trigger** You take the [[Leap]] action.

Tradition says the dragonfly fulu should be affixed to the upper back, like the wings of an insect. When you Activate this fulu, you gain a +2 status bonus to Athletics checks to [[High Jump]] or [[Long Jump]] for 1 minute. During this time, you can attempt an Athletics check to High Jump or Long Jump as a single action without the Stride requirement. You can also High Jump or Long Jump from a nonsolid substance, such as air or water, but if you use this power of the fulu, its effects ends after you jump.
