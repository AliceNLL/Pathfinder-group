![[icons-equipment-head-helm-spangen.webp|150]]

Repurposing and enchanting a helmet worn by a battlefield commander can create a tactician's helm, imparting knowledge of battlefield tactics that feeds off your minor victories. The helm grants you a +1 item bonus to Warfare Lore checks. Also, a jewel adorns the brow of the helmet. This jewel becomes charged each time you hit a creature with a [[Reactive Strike]]. A tactician's helm can hold up to 2 charges, and its charges reset to 0 when you invest it.
