# Empath's Cordial
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-consumable.svg|150]]

**Activate** 1 Interact

The pale liquid of empath's cordial changes color to reflect the mood of the creature nearest to itâ€”turning blue for calm, red for anger, and green for envious, among other hues. For 1 hour after you drink this potion, you can sense the presence of general emotions, such as hostility toward you or the presence of an emotion effect impacting a creature's emotions, within 30 feet. A creature that failed a saving throw against calm emotions can't be detected. This potion doesn't allow you to automatically tell what emotions a specific creature is experiencing, but you can attempt a Perception check with a +2 item bonus (DC set by the GM) to discern that information. The potion also grants you a +1 item bonus to Perception checks to [[Sense Motive]] against creatures whose emotions you can sense.
