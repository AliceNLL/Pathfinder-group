# Rusting Carapace
![[icons-equipment-chest-breastplate-scale-leather.webp|150]]

This _+1 leather lamellar_ armor incorporates the plates of a rust monster's hide, woven together with the creature's own antennae and sinew into a functional set of armor. While wearing the _rusting carapace_, you gain a +2 item bonus to your Reflex save to prevent an object you're holding from being affected by rust; this also increases your Reflex DC to avoid being Disarmed by a rust monster's Antenna [[Disarm]] ability.

**Activate** 2 Interact

**Frequency** once per day

**Effect** Feathery antennae extend from between the segments of the rusting hide and brush against a nearby metal creature, non-magical metal hazard, or non-magical metal item of up to 1 Bulk, with the effects of _[[Rusting Grasp]]_ DC 24 fortitude.

**Craft Requirements** The initial raw materials must include the hide of a rust monster.
