# Horn of Exorcism
![[icons-commodities-treasure-horn-spiral-pink.webp|150]]

A _horn of exorcism_ is an instrument made from an animal horn, or an object of the same shape from carved wood or ivory.

* * *

**Activate—Rattle the Dead** 1 (auditory, manipulate)

**Frequency** once per hour

**Effect** Blowing into the horn frightens ghosts and evil spirits who can hear its call. Make an Intimidation check to [[Demoralize]] against all creatures with the undead or unholy trait in a 30 foot emanation. This can affect even a mindless creature with that trait, and you don't take a penalty when you attempt to Demoralize a creature that doesn't understand your language.

* * *

**Activate—Sacred Seeds** 2 (manipulate)

**Frequency** once per day

**Effect** You fill the horn with sacred seeds and then scatter them around you with a twist of your wrist. The horn grants you and your allies in a 30 foot emanation the _ghost touch_ property rune on all of your weapon and unarmed Strikes for 1 minute.
