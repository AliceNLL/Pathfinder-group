# Druid's Crown
![[icons-equipment-head-crown-horns-brown.webp|150]]

Made of materials scavenged from wild places, a _druid's crown_ can be rebuilt for a variety of benefits. The crown grants you a +1 item bonus to and can be activated to cast a spell, both depending on the material used to build the crown, as listed on the table below. If you invest and wear _druid's vestments_ along with the crown, the crown's item bonus increases by 1 and its spell's DC rises to 27. You can invest this item only if you're a druid. When you do, as a 10-minute activity that has the manipulate trait, you can disassemble and rebuild the crown with different materials, changing its item bonus and spell accordingly.
