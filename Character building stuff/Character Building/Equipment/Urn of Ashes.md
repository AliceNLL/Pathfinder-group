# Urn of Ashes
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-held-items-urn-of-ashes.webp|150]]

This sealed pewter urn contains the ashes of a benevolent ancestor, with a sliver of lingering spirit that strives to protect you.

**Activate** R envision

**Trigger** You would become doomed or your doomed value would increase

**Requirements** The ashes aren't doomed

* * *

**Effect** The ashes in the urn intervene, taking the doomed condition in your place, and you don't gain or increase the value of your own doomed condition. Each night when you get a full night's rest, you can reduce your own doomed condition or that of the urn, but not both.

* * *

**Activate** 1envision, interact (attack)

**Frequency** once per round

* * *

**Effect** The urn shoots a bolt of void energy at a foe within 30 feet.

Attempt a spell attack roll against the target's AC, using a modifier of `dice: 1d20+15` or your own spell attack roll modifier, whichever is higher. On a success, the bolt deals 4d4 void damage (doubled on a critical success).
