# The Teamster

**Suit** Shield (Con)

**Alignment** neutral

* * *

_The Teamster_ represents the driving force to push on, no matter the circumstance. As long as you have _The Teamster_ invested, all single-target effects that target you and require a saving throw gain the incapacitation trait. If the effect originates from a creature or effect of a level higher than yours, it doesn't gain the incapacitation trait in this way.

**Activate** f envision

**Trigger** you are affected by an ongoing condition

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** You push through your largest hindrance. Select one of the following conditions currently affecting you: [[Blinded]], [[Clumsy 1|Clumsy]], [[Confused]], [[Controlled]], [[Dazzled]], [[Deafened]], [[Doomed]], [[Drained 1|Drained]], [[Dying]], [[Enfeebled 1|Enfeebled]], [[Fascinated]], [[Fatigued]], [[Frightened]], [[Grabbed]], [[Immobilized]], [[Paralyzed]], [[Persistent Damage]], [[Petrified]], [[Restrained]], [[Sickened 1|Sickened]], [[Slowed|Slowed]], [[Stunned 1|Stunned]], [[Stupefied]], [[Unconscious]], or [[Wounded]]. If the source of the condition is more than 4 levels lower than your current level, The Teamster automatically counters the condition. Otherwise, The Teamster attempts to counter the condition, with a counteract modifier of +31.
