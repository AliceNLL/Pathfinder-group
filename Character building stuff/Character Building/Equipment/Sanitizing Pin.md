**Activate** f command

**Trigger** You attempt a saving throw against a disease or poison.

* * *

This pin includes a piece of gauze wrapped around a dried herbal poultice. When you activate the sanitizing pin, the poultice dissolves and bolsters your body's defense against poison or disease. You gain a +2 status bonus on your Fortitude save against the initial exposure to the affliction. If you roll a critical failure on the triggering attempt, you get a failure instead.
