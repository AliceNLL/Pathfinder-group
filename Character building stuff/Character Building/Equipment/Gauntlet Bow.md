![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-weapons-gauntlet-bow.webp|150]]

The gauntlet bow is a heavy metal glove with a built-in crossbow and rotating chamber mechanism for easy reloading. A gauntlet bow can be used to make melee attacks like a standard gauntlet. You can't reload a gauntlet bow with the hand wielding it.
