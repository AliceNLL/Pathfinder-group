# Everlight Crystal
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-held-items-everburning-torch.webp|150]]

An _everlight crystal_ is one of the most common applications of permanent magic. This stone or gem sheds magical light constantly, requiring no oxygen and generating no heat. The crystal can be covered, but the light can't be extinguished.
