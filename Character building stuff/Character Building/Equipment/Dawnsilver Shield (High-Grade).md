![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-shields-precious-material-shields-mithral-shield.webp|150]]

Dawnsilver shields are 1 Bulk lighter than normal (or light Bulk if their normal Bulk is 1, with no effect on a shield that normally has light Bulk). When used for a shield bash, they're treated as silver weapons.

The shield has Hardness 8, HP 32, and BT 16.

**Craft Requirements** at least 4,400 gp of mithral
