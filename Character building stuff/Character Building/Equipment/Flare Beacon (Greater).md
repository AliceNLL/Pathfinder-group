Flare beacons create an incredibly bright light for a brief period of time. They are often used to signal others to the beacon's location, to coordinate assaults, to request rescue, or for other similar reasons. Higher-level beacons have a radius so large that they can be seen from miles away at night. When you Activate a flare beacon, you can either place it on the ground in a space within your reach or toss it up to 60 feet straight up. A flare beacon in the air falls at a rate of 10 feet per round.

The beacon shines bright light in a 100-foot radius and dim light in the next 100 feet. Creatures within a 20-foot radius of the beacon must succeed at a DC 27 fortitude save or be dazzled until they are no longer within 20 feet of it. Additionally, on a critical failure, they are also blinded for 1 round.
