# Dreamstone
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-held-items-dreamstone.webp|150]]

A _dreamstone_ is a disc-shaped object carved with imagery or words sacred to Desna-be it her religious symbol, a short prayer, or merely the shape of a single star. When you carry a _dreamstone_, you find it easier to fall asleep, and you gain improved effects from the resulting rest. You always fall asleep within 5 minutes of lying down with the intention of sleeping, and you require only 2 hours of sleep per day to gain the benefits of 8 hours of sleep, provided you have carried the _dreamstone_ for at least 24 hours prior to resting. As long as you carry a _dreamstone_, you gain a +2 item bonus to saving throws against sleep effects.

**Activate** A Interact (metamagic)

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell of 4th level or lower that has the sleep trait or is associated with dreams, the spell slot is not expended.
