Contagion metabolizers seek out toxins in the bloodstream and attempt to purify them into humors the body processes naturally. When you drink this elixir, it attempts a counteract check with a +11 modifier to remove the highest-level poison or disease afflicting you. The elixir has a counteract level of 3. This takes longer for a disease—the counteract check doesn't happen until 10 minutes after you drink the elixir. After drinking, you become temporarily immune to contagion metabolizers for 1 hour.

If you're a chirurgeon alchemist and have powerful alchemy, you can substitute your statistics when you create a contagion metabolizer using Quick Alchemy, if your stats are higher. This replaces the counteract level with half your level rounded up and the counteract modifier with your class DC – 10.
