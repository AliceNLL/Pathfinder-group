# Hunter's Bane
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-consumables-talismans-hunters-bane.webp|150]]

**Usage** affixed to armor

**Activate** F Envision

**Trigger** An undetected enemy hits you with an attack

**Requirements** You are trained in Survival

This talisman is a ring of dried, interwoven leaves. When you activate the _hunter's bane_, you sense the exact location of the attacker, making it hidden from you instead of undetected. If the attacker is behind lead, the _hunter's bane_ fails and is wasted.
