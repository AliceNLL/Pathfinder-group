# Chair Storage
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-other-attached-items-chair-storage.webp|150]]

Chair storage can be purchased and applied to any wheelchair. This reduces the amount of Bulk the items weigh when stored within the chair, much like a backpack. The first 2 Bulk of items stowed in your chair don't count against your Bulk limit. If you use both chair storage and a backpack at the same time, only 2 Bulk total isn't counted against your limit, much like if you used multiple backpacks or similar items at the same time.
