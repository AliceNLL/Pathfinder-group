# Incense Bundle of Annual Blessings
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-consumable.svg|150]]

The twelve incense sticks wrapped in this bundle vary in shade and color, reflecting the deities the months are named after. Offering all incense sticks to their respective deities within a week is said to bring unparalleled luck, though gaining entry to all the necessary shrines and temples can pose quite a challenge. Those that complete the challenge gain can, when affected by a misfortune effect, automatically disrupt it as the incense wards off the bad luck. This ability can be used once a month for the next 12 months.
