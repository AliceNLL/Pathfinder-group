# King's Sleep
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-alchemical-items-alchemical-poisons-kings-sleep.webp|150]]

King's sleep is an insidious long-term poison that can seem like a disease or even death from natural causes on a venerable target. The drained condition from king's sleep is cumulative with each failed save and can't be removed while the poison lasts.
