# Antivenom Potion
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-consumables-potions-silver-dragons-breath-potion.webp|150]]

This cloudy, white liquid helps protect against poisons. When you drink an antivenom potion, you can immediately attempt a DC 10 flat to end any persistent poison damage you're taking. In addition, for 1 minute after drinking the potion, you gain a +1 bonus to Fortitude saving throws to avoid taking persistent poison damage.
