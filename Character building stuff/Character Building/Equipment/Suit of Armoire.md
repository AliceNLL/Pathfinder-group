# Suit of Armoire
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-armor.svg|150]]

**Price** An indeterminate amount of one's lifespan, spent driving to the magic item warehouse, navigating its labyrinthine corridors, and consuming meatballs. Also some gold.

* * *

This classic, timeless suit of _+1 resilient full plate_ is personally assembled from modular pieces of flat-packed darkwood, doubling as furniture and personal protective gear. To wear or remove the suit of armoire, you must succeed at a DC 41 crafting save or be overcome with frustration at how you can't follow the simple, easy-to-understand diagrams for assembling the armoire, imposing a -1 status penalty to Will saves for 1 hour.

* * *

**Activate** 1 Interact; Once per day; You did not fail at the check to assemble the suit of armoire today

* * *

**Effect** You open a set of doors on the armoire's front, producing one fancy suit of clothes of your choosing.

* * *

**Activate** r Interact; An enemy hits or critically hits you with a Strike, or you fail or critically fail a Reflex save; You did fail the check to assemble the suit of armoire at least once today

* * *

**Effect** You forgot a peg or bolt when you were assembling the suit of armoire, causing it to collapse to pieces around you, though this shields you from harm. The triggering attack is a failure, or you succeed at your Reflex save. The suit of armoire falls apart around you into its constituent panels, leaving you unarmored.
