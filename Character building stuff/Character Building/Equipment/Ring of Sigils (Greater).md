# Ring of Sigils (Greater)
![[icons-equipment-finger-ring-band-engraved-scrolls-bronze.webp|150]]

This silver band is carved with the personal sigils of different individuals, adding one to represent you when you invest it. The ring allows you to cast _[[Sigil]]_ as an arcane innate cantrip.

**Activateâ€”Track Sigil**1 (concentrate, detection)

****Frequency** once per** 10 minutes

* * *

**Effect** You detect the general direction toward the most recent _sigil_ you created using the ring. This activation fails if the _sigil_ is more than 100 miles away or if there's lead or running water between you and the _sigil_. In addition, if the _sigil_ was placed on a living creature, you also determine whether the creature is alive, its distance from you, and any conditions affecting it.
