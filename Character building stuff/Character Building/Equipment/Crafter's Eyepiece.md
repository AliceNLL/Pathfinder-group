![[icons-tools-scribal-lens-blue.webp|150]]

This rugged metal eyepiece etched with square patterns is designed to be worn over a single eye. Twisting the lens reveals a faint three-dimensional outline of an item you plan to build or repair, with helpful labels on the component parts.

You gain a +1 item bonus to Crafting checks. When you Repair an item, increase the Hit Points restored to 10 + 10 per proficiency rank on a success or 15 + 15 per proficiency rank on a critical success.
