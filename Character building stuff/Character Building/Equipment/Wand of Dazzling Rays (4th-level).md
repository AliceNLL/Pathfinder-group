# Wand of Dazzling Rays (4th-level)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-equipment.svg|150]]

Solidified radiance comprises this slender, featureless wand. It sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for the next 20 feet. After you Activate the wand, the light fades, so it only sheds dim light in a 20-foot radius. The wand returns to its original brightness each dawn.

**Activate** Cast a Spell

**Frequency** once per day, plus overcharge

* * *

**Effect** You cast 4th-level _[[Holy Light]]_, dazzling your target with the beam's intensity. A creature that takes damage from the spell is [[Blinded]] for 1 round and [[Dazzled]] for a number of rounds equal to the spell level. On a critical success on the attack roll, the target is also blinded for as long as it's dazzled from the spell. However, it can attempt a Fortitude saving throw against your spell DC at the end of each of its turns, ending the blinded condition on a success (but remaining dazzled).

Craft Requirements Supply a casting of _[[Holy Light]]_ of the appropriate level.
