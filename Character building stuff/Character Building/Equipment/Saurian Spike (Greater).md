# Saurian Spike (Greater)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-equipment.svg|150]]

This jagged, bony growth narrows to a sharp, pointed tip. Deep groves from some former battle scar its surface. The bearer of a _saurian spike_ often feels a sudden surge in power and confidence.

*   **Armor** You gain imprecise scent with a range of 60 feet.
*   **Weapon**(auditory, emotion, fear, visual) When you cast a polymorph spell by activating the spike, your battle form is exceptionally fearsome. Each enemy in a 60 foot emanation must succeed at a DC 28 will saving throw or become [[Frightened|Frightened 1]] ([[Frightened|Frightened 2]] on a critical failure).

**Activate** Cast a Spell

* * *

**Effect** You cast _[[Gouging Claw]]_.

**Frequency** once per day
