A broad wooden tube with a handle, a _sparking spellgun_ radiates warmth. You Activate the spellgun by aiming it at one creature and making your choice of a spell attack roll or a firearm attack roll against the target's AC. This spellgun has a range increment of 30 feet. The spellgun fires a small ball of sparks and fire, then crumbles to ash. The ball explodes in a flash when it hits, dealing 7d6 fire damage and `dice: 3d4` persistent,fire damage.
