These folding, wood-framed spectacles hold flat discs of cut crystal as lenses and are held in place with thin cords that wrap around each ear, with another strap holding them around the neck while not in use. While you are wearing the spectacles, you gain a +2 item bonus to checks to Decipher Writing.
