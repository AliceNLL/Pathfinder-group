# Fiendish Teleportation
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-contracts-infernal-contracts-fiendish-teleportation.webp|150]]

You tap into the fiendish ability to slip through space. When you Stride, you gain a +3 item bonus to Armor Class against reactions triggered by your movement. Once per day, from any distance, Abrogail Thrune II can call on a provision in your Thrune contract as a single action, causing you to become _paralyzed_ for 1 hour or until Abrogail releases you, whichever comes first.

**Activate** 2 command

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** You recite a subclause of your contract regarding change in venue. You cast dimension _door._ The space you leave and the one you appear in are filled with the scent of brimstone, dealing 2d6 spirit damage to creatures adjacent to both spaces.
