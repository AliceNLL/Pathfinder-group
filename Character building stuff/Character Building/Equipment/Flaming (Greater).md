# Flaming (Greater)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-runes-weapon-property-runes-weapon-property-runes.webp|150]]

A weapon with this rune is empowered by flickering flame. The weapon deals an additional 1d6 fire damage on a successful Strike, plus 2d10 persistent fire damage on a critical hit.

Fire damage dealt by this weapon (including the persistent fire damage) ignores the target's fire resistance.
