# Bioluminescence Bomb
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-alchemical-items-alchemical-bombs-bottled-sunlight.webp|150]]

**Activate** 1 Strike

* * *

This vial of glowing goo constantly sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius. When a bioluminescence bomb strikes a creature or a hard surface, it shatters and releases the bioluminescent fluid's energy in a flare of light. Each creature within 10 foot burst{10 feet} of where the bomb exploded must succeed at a DC 17 reflex saving throw against the overwhelming burst of light.

* * *

**Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Failure** The creature is [[Dazzled]] for 1 round.

**Critical Failure** The creature is [[Blinded]] for 1 round, then dazzled for 1 round.
