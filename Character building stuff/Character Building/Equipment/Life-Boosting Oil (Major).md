**Activate** 1 Interact

When you apply sticky, stinging life-boosting oil, you gain fast healing 15 that starts the first time you take damage while the oil lasts. Once the fast healing starts, the oil remains effective for 4 rounds. However, the oil lasts only 8 hours, whether it provides fast healing or not.
