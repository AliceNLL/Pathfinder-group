# Spellbreaking (Evocation)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-runes-armor-property-runes-armor-property-runes.webp|150]]

Counter-runes specific to a particular school of magic provide protections against that school. You gain a +1 status bonus to saving throws and AC against one school of magic: abjuration, conjuration, divination, enchantment, evocation, illusion, necromancy, or transmutation. The crafter chooses the school when creating the rune.
