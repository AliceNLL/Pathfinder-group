# O-Yoroi
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-armor-o-yoroi.webp|150]]

Larger plates coupled with lamellar pieces to make up a suit of heavy lamellar. The custom-fitted and often highly decorative suit covers most of the body. Rounding out the suit are a tiered helmet and fearsome mask, often depicting a fiendish or monstrous creature.
