# Piercing Wind
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-weapons-piercing-wind.webp|150]]

Favored by caravan guards who traverse the Mana Wastes, a piercing wind is similar to a [[Jezail]], in that you can carry it in one hand as long as the other hand's free, by holding it under one arm. Additionally, it's fitted with an underslung curved blade.
