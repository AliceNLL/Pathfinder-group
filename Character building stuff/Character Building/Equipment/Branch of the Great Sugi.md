# Branch of the Great Sugi
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-weapons-whip.webp|150]]

This large tree branch is alive, despite having been harvested from the sugi tree it once belonged to. This long, flexible, and limber branch is a _+1 striking whip_. When used to Strike, the branch snaps with the sound of a cracking whip but fills the air surrounding the point of impact with the pleasant scent of freshly cut cedar and a sprinkling of fallen leaves on the ground.

**Activate** 3 envision, Interact

**Frequency** once per day

**Effect** You place the _branch of the great sugi_ on the corpse of an evil creature, then cause the branch to suddenly grow into a sugi tree, up to 25 feet tall with a 2-foot-wide trunk. As it grows, it emits a pulse of soothing energy, restoring `dice: 3d8+8` healing Hit Points to all creatures in a 10 foot burst. A character can Climb the tree with a successful DC 10 athletics check, and its branches effortlessly support the weight of any Medium or smaller creature. The sugi tree reverts to its whip form after 1 hour unless you transform it back before then.
