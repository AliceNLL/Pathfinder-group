# Hairpin of Blooming Flowers
![[icons-commodities-flowers-lotus-pink.webp|150]]

The flower that adorns this hairpin is a blooming lotus flower that varies in color; it regrows in a day after the item is activated. Whether or not the hairpin's flower is in bloom, as long as you wear it and it's invested, it grants a +1 item bonus to Diplomacy checks.

**Activate** 2 envision, Interact

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** You pluck the flower from the hairpin and scatter the petals, creating a flurry of color in a 10 foot burst centered on you. You become [[Concealed]] for 1 minute or until you move from your current location. Any creature within the 10 foot burst when you Activate the Item must succeed at a DC 23 reflex save or become [[Dazzled]] until the end of its next turn (or [[Blinded]] until the end of its next turn on a critical failure). The flower blooms again the next day.
