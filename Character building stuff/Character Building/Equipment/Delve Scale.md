If fried, a bulette's thick forefoot scales render into crunchy snacks. Alchemists add reagents to the frying oil to enhance the scales' properties and flavor. For 1 minute after eating a delve scale, you gain a burrow Speed of 15 feet and a +2 item bonus to Athletics checks to [[High Jump]] or [[Long Jump]].
