# Ghost Ampoule
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-alchemical-items-alchemical-tools-ghost-ampoule.webp|150]]

**Activate** 2 Interact

A daub of ectoplasm twitches within this glass container, faintly glowing with ghostly light. When opened it forms the echo of a departed spirit, which looks like a Medium ghost. You can throw the ampoule up to 30 feet when you Activate it. The ghost utters a final lament, forcing each living creature in a 15 foot emanation except you to attempt a DC 18 will save. On a failure, a creature becomes [[Frightened|Frightened 2]] (or [[Frightened|Frightened 3]] on a critical failure).

**Craft Requirements** Supply ectoplasmic residue from a destroyed ghost.
