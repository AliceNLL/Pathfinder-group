These goggles feature highly reflective lenses. While wearing the goggles, you gain a +1 item bonus to visual Perception checks and to saving throws against visual effects.

**Effect** You turn your head to reflect aspects of the triggering effect back at its creator. The creature must attempt a DC 20 fortitude save as it becomes disoriented by this reflection. On a failure, the creature is [[Sickened 1]] ([[Sickened 1|Sickened 2]] on a critical failure). The creature is temporarily immune for 1 hour.
