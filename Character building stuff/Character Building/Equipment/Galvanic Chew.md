# Galvanic Chew
![[icons-magic-lightning-bolt-cloud-sky-white.webp|150]]

**Activate** 1 Interact

A galvanic chew is a processed ball of dried electric eel, roasted until chewy and coated in spicy, reagent-infused powder that tingles with electricity as you chew. For up to 1 hour, you have resistance 5 to electricity.

* * *

**Secondary Effect** r (electricity)

**Trigger** You're hit by a melee attack or touched by a creature

**Effect** You channel electricity into the triggering creature, which must succeed at a DC 24 fortitude save or be [[Stunned 1]] (or [[Stunned 1|Stunned 2]] on a critical failure). The chew becomes inert. You're then temporarily immune to galvanic chews for 24 hours or until the next time you make your daily preparations.
