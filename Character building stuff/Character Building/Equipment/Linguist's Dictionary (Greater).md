**Frequency** once per day

**Requirements** Your last action was to cast a spell prepared from this grimoire that allows understanding of another language, such as _[[Translate]]_ or _[[Truespeech]]_

**Effect** The grimoire absorbs knowledge of one language translated this way (caster's choice if more than one), allowing its bearer to communicate on a rudimentary level in that language even after the spell's duration has elapsed. The _greater linguist's dictionary_ can hold three languages at a time.
