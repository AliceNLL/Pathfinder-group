**Activate** A Interact

This gummy liquid disproportionately lengthens your legs, causing you to grow but making your movement awkward. The effect is very noticeable unless your clothes can adequately conceal it.

**Benefit** You gain a +2 item bonus to Athletics checks and you gain a +10 foot status bonus to your Speed. In addition, you grow one size larger, but your larger size does not have any additional effects beyond the potential change in space.

**Drawback** You take a -1 penalty to AC and a -2 penalty to Reflex saves.

**Duration** 1 minute.
