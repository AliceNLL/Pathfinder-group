# Energizing Lattice
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-armor-lattice-armor.webp|150]]

This suit of _+2 resilient fortification lattice armor_ has latticework of fine golden wire. After negating a critical hit with its _fortification_ rune, the latticework glows for 1 minute, shedding bright light in a 20-foot radius (and dim light for the next 20 feet). You can Dismiss this light.

**Activate** 2 envision (force)

**Requirements** The _energizing lattice_ is glowing because it negated an enemy's critical hit

* * *

**Effect** You release the lattice's energy and make a weapon or unarmed attack Strike that deals 6d6 force{6d6 additional force damage}. If your Strike fails, but doesn't critically fail, the target still takes half the force damage. The latticework ceases glowing after the Strike.
