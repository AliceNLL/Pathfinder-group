# Spun Cloud (White)

On the Elemental Plane of Air, small clouds of differing colors can sometimes float separately from other cloud formations. Clever people can spin these clouds into small handfuls, creating a magical bundle of elemental power. Unlike most bottled breath, _spun clouds_ don't have any effect on you while you hold them in your lungs, but you can exhale the cloud as a single action. When exhaled, the cloud flows out and expands into a 20 foot burst within 60 feet of you. The cloud dissipates after 1 minute.

A white cloud swirls with winds that speed up travel. A creature that starts its turn in the cloud gains a +10-foot item bonus to its land Speed and fly Speed (if it has one) until the end of its turn.
