# Bladed Diabolo
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-weapons-bladed-diabolo.webp|150]]

This weapon consists of two bladed discs joined by a central axel, and is spun on a rope whose ends are attached to wand-like sticks. The wielder can hurl the diabolo from the rope like a stone from a sling, or swing it on the rope in melee.
