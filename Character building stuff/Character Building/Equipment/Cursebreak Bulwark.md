# Cursebreak Bulwark
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-shields-specific-shields-cursebreaker-bulwark.webp|150]]

This tower shield is composed of interlocking hexagonal wooden tiles lined with metal. The tiles are painted a verdant green, and each is marked with a faded rune that protects against curses. While you have this shield raised, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against spells that target you, increasing to a +2 circumstance bonus against curses. You can unleash the energy stored in the shield to destroy a curse before it can affect you.

AC increases to +4 if you are using the [[Take Cover]] action.
