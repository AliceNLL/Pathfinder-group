# Bralani Breath
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-consumable.svg|150]]

**Activate** Cast a Spell (add 1 action)

Bralani breath is a species of mint with small, green flowers, said to grow on battlefields where the opposing sides were equally matched. Sprigs of the flowers blow gently in a breeze of their own creation. If you cast _[[Mystic Armor]]_ using bralani breath, you release a small blast of concussive air in an emanation of a size that depends on the catalyst's type. Some unattended objects are pushed away from you. Large or smaller creatures must succeed at a DC resolve fortitude save equal to your spell save DC or be pushed the same distance away from you.

Objects of 1 Bulk or less and creatures that fail the save are pushed 5 feet.
