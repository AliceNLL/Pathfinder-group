# Dawnlight (Greater)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-held-items-dawnlight.webp|150]]

This shining symbol of Sarenrae depicts the goddess with her arms held wide. In the center of the symbol is a crystal reliquary with a perfect feather floating inside, glowing bright as a candle with the light of the goddess.

**Activate** Cast a Spell

**Frequency** once per day for each spell

**Effect** The _dawnlight_ casts 3rd-level _[[Vitality Lash]]_ or _[[Light]]_. The _dawnlight_'s spell attack roll and counteract modifier are +13, and any spell with the light trait is treated as though its counteract level were 1 higher for counteracting darkness.

Whenever you successfully counteract magical darkness while holding this symbol, the clash of magic unleashes a momentary flash of light. Creatures with darkvision in the area of the light spell or targeted by it must succeed at a DC 23 fortitude or be [[Dazzled]] for 1 round. Those with light blindness are also exposed to bright light.

**Craft Requirements** You have a spellcasting class feature with the divine tradition.
