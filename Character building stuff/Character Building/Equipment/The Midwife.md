**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** A creature you can sense within 60 feet would die or be destroyed

**Effect** You prevent the target from dying or being destroyed and restore to the target `dice: 6d8+24` healing Hit Points. This effect can prevent a death effect or _[[Disintegrate]]_ from slaying a target. The amount of healing granted increases to `dice: 7d8+28` healing if you're at least 15th level, `dice: 8d8+32` healing if you're at least 17th level, and `dice: 9d8+36` healing if you're at least 19th level.
