# Rustbringer
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-weapon.svg|150]]

The handle, chain, and spiked ball of this _+1 striking corrosive flail_ are all made of iron so rusted that the weapon appears nonfunctional at first glance. On Strikes against a creature that's primarily made of metal, it gains the deadly d10 trait.

**Activateâ€”Rusting Disarm** R

**Trigger** You critically succeed at a [[Disarm]] attempt with the flail against a metal weapon

* * *

**Effect** Flakes of acid-laden rust are deposited on the disarmed weapon. The weapon takes 2d6 damage, ignoring the weapon's Hardness.
