# Warcaller's Chime of Dread
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-equipment.svg|150]]

This chime's carvings depict skulls and other grim icons. When activated, it creates an aura of _[[Fear]]_ in a 5 foot emanation for 1 round. Creatures in the aura must attempt a DC 27 will save. On a failure, they become [[Frightened|Frightened 1]] ([[Frightened|Frightened 2]] on a critical failure). Affected creatures can't reduce their frightened condition below frightened 1 while the chime is ringing. You can Sustain the Activation to sustain the aura, up to a total of 5 rounds. This chime can be used only once per day, whether or not you Sustain the aura.
