# Grim Sandglass
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-other-spellhearts-grim-sandglass.webp|150]]

One bulb of this tiny hourglass contains black sand, the other white. After even a few grains pass from one side to the other, it reverses its flow to keep the two sides in equilibrium. The spell DC of any spell cast by Activating this item is 17.

*   **Armor** You gain resistance 2 to void.
*   **Weapon** After you cast a necromancy spell by Activating the _sandglass_, your Strikes with the weapon deal an additional 1d4 void damage until the end of your next turn.
