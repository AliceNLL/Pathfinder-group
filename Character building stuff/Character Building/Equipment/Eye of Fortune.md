Adherents of Erastil, god of the hunt, create these magical eye patches. An _eye of fortune_ has a jeweled eye symbol on its front, allowing you to magically see through the eye patch as though it were transparent.

**Activateâ€”Luck Beyond Sight** F (concentrate, fortune)

**Trigger** You attack a concealed or hidden creature and haven't attempted the flat check yet

* * *

**Effect** You can roll the flat check for the concealed or hidden condition twice and use the higher result.
