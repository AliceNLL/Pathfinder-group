![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-weapons-specific-magic-weapons-frost-brand.webp|150]]

The blade of this +2 greater striking [[Frost (Greater)]] greatsword appears to be nothing but icy shards. The frost brand automatically extinguishes non-magical fires in a 20 foot emanation. While wielding it, you gain fire resistance 5.

**Activate** D command, Interact

* * *

**Effect** You swing the _frost brand_ into the area of an ongoing magical fire, and the blade attempts to counteract the fire with a counteract modifier of +27. If it fails, it can't attempt to counteract the same fire again.
