# Armor of the Holy Warrior
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-armor-specific-magic-armor-armor-of-the-holy-warrior.webp|150]]

Based on the armors used by the holy warriors who served under General Arnisant in the Shining Crusade, this well-polished _+2 greater resilient half plate_ is decorated with religious motifs and carved with sacred scripture. While wearing armor of the holy warrior, your item bonus from the _greater resilient rune_ increases from +2 to +3; if you upgrade to a _major resilient rune_, the item bonus instead increases from +3 to +4. An undead that critically fails an unarmed attack against you while you wear this armor takes 1d6 vitality damage.

If you are evil, you're [[Enfeebled 1|Enfeebled 2]] while wearing the armor. If you're undead, you also take 2d6 vitality damage each round that you wear the armor.
