# Wand of Slaying (8th-Level Spell)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-wands-specialty-wands-wand-of-slaying.webp|150]]

This polished black wand has a green gem at the tip, and anyone who looks into it sees a reflection of a grinning skull instead of their face.

**Activate** Cast a Spell

**Frequency** Once per day, plus overcharge

* * *

**Effect** You cast _[[Execute]]_ at 8th level.

If the spell slays its target, the corpse releases void energy in a 20 foot emanation, dealing void damage equal to double the spell's level (16 void damage).

* * *

**Craft Requirements** Supply a casting of finger of death of the appropriate level.
