# Shining Shield
![[icons-equipment-shield-round-wooden-boss-steel-yellow-blue.webp|150]]

Kalabrynne Iomedar commissioned the first of these shields, which have become some of the Shining Sentinels' most valued equipment, replicated among these knights. A _shining shield_ is a seemingly simple wooden shield with the Shining Oath engraved on the inside.

While raised, a _shining shield_ moves itself to provide cover for your allies. If you have this shield raised and would provide cover to an ally against a foe by standing between them, the cover you provide increases one step. Thus, if you were to grant lesser cover, you grant standard cover instead; if you were to grant standard cover, you instead grant greater cover.

**Effect** You shout an oath to protect the innocent and weak, and the shield gives off bright light. All enemies in a 30 foot emanation around you must attempt a DC 27 will save, with the following effects.

**Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Failure** For 1 round, the creature ignores other creatures in the area and concentrates on bringing you down. The creature will still attack anyone preventing them from attacking you, uses tactics deemed most convenient to defeat you, and works with other creatures that confront you.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but the duration is 1 minute.
