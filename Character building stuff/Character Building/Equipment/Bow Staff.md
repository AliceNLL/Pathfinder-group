# Bow Staff
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-weapon.svg|150]]

The bow staff is a whipstaff with a retracting spool of wire inside a metal cap on one end and a hooked protrusion on the other. A wielder trained in the weapon's use can quickly spool and attach or detach the wire to transition the weapon between bow and staff functionality.
