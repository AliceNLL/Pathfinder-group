* * *

This device has four finger-like latches centered around a whirring mass of gears.

After winding the _clockwork rejuvenator_, you can latch it to the chest of an adjacent recently dead creature and return it to life. If you wound the rejuvenator using 1 Interact action, you can return to life a creature that died in the last 2 rounds, restoring it to 1 HP. If you wound the rejuvenator using 2 Interact actions, you can return to life a creature that died within the last 3 rounds. After attaching, the device continues to whirl for 1 minute, restoring 10 HP per round to the target. Thereafter, the _clockwork rejuvenator_ loses its magic and becomes inert.
