# Stalwart's Ring
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-worn-items-other-worn-items-stalwarts-ring.webp|150]]

This fairly simple ring has no gemstone inlaid, but the band is cast to resembled a fanged wolf's head.

Once per day, during your daily preparations, you can meditate on this ring to grant yourself 5 temporary Hit Points. These last until your next daily preparation, as long as you are wearing the ring.
