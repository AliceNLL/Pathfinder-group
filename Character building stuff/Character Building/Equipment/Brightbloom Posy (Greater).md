# Brightbloom Posy (Greater)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-equipment.svg|150]]

Appearing as vibrant as the day they were picked, this cluster of flowers is arranged in a small spray, tied with a red satin ribbon. The spell DC of any spell cast by activating this item is 28.

*   **Armor** You gain the ability to speak with flowers, as _[[Speak with Plants]]_.
*   **Weapon** (disease) After you cast a plant spell by activating the posy, pollen coats your weapon. Your next Strike causes the target to be [[Sickened 1]] on a hit ([[Sickened 1|Sickened 2]] on a critical hit). If the creature attempts to recover, it sneezes rather than retching (rolling against the spellheart's spell DC). If you don't make a Strike by the end of your next turn, the pollen becomes inert. Plant creatures are immune.
