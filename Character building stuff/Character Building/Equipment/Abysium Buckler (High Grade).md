# Abysium Buckler (High Grade)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-shields-precious-material-shields-abysium-buckler.webp|150]]

These glowing shields are crafted to ensure that the abysium used is safely contained within a durable outer shell. If the shield breaks, however, the toxic metal becomes exposed. When you use the [[Shield Block]] reaction against an adjacent creature's melee Strike, if the shield breaks, the creature is exposed to the abysium and is [[Sickened 1|Sickened 2]].

**Craft Requirements** abysium worth at least 4,000 gp
