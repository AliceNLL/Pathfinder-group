# Wondrous Figurine (Marble Elephant)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-held-items-wondrous-figurine-marble-elephant.webp|150]]

Finely carved from a solid piece of marble, this gleaming elephant statuette becomes a fully grown [[Elephant]] when activated.

The elephant can be called upon no more than four times per month. It remains for 24 hours as long as it is being used as a beast of burden or for transport.

If it attempts an attack or otherwise engages in combat, it reverts to statuette form after `dice: 1d4` rounds.
