**Activate** 1 Strike

A thick, sulfurous, irritating gas fills this golden-yellow flask. You gain a +3 item bonus to attack rolls. The bomb deals 4d4 acid damage and 4 acid splash damage. On a hit, the target takes a -1 status penalty to Perception checks and attack rolls until the end of its next turn, or becomes [[Sickened 1]] on a critical hit. Creatures hit with this bomb are temporarily immune to the effects of the bomb for 1 minute.
