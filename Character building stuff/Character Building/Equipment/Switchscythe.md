# Switchscythe
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-weapons-switchscythe.webp|150]]

Another complex gnome invention, the switchscythe is designed for versatility. The curved blade is partly hollow, containing a long rod of wood or metal; the rod can be pulled perpendicular to the blade, turning the switchscythe from a sweeping, axe-like blade into a hooked pick capable of grappling a foe.
