# Bellicose Dagger
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-weapons-dagger.webp|150]]

The hilt of a bellicose dagger is etched with the word for "war" in various languages. Having absorbed the spirit of violence over the course of its existence, the weapon now craves bloodshed. A bellicose dagger is a _+1 striking wounding dagger_. However, anytime you interact with creatures, no matter the context, you must succeed at a DC 25 will save or else find you have, as a reaction, drawn the dagger.

When you use the bellicose dagger as a weapon for the first time, it fuses to you. While it's in your possession, you take a â€“2 circumstance penalty to Diplomacy checks and skill checks to avoid fighting, such as Deception checks to trick your way out of a scuffle or Stealth checks to sneak past enemies.
