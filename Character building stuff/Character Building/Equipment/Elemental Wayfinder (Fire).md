# Elemental Wayfinder (Fire)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-worn-items-other-worn-items-elemental-wayfinder-fire.webp|150]]

Pathfinder Society researchers recently created elemental wayfinders with the assistance of the Society's elemental allies. In addition to the effects of a [[Wayfinder]], these wayfinders each grant the ability to cast a particular elemental spell once per day, and can assist Pathfinders in exploring areas associated with their element. Each has the trait associated with its element.
