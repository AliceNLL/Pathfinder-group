**Activate 1** (manipulate)

* * *

Distilled from the energy of dangerous spells, an energy breath potion grants you the Energy Breath action for 1 hour after you imbibe the concoction.

**Energy Breath 1** You create a 15 foot cone of cold which deals 10d6 cold damage. All creatures in the area must attempt a DC 37 Basic reflex save.

After you use Energy Breath, you can't do so again for `dice: 1d4` rounds.
