This bright red-and-gold cape is often interlaced with glittery threads and serves as a distraction. While wearing the cape, you gain a +2 item bonus to Deception checks.

**Activateâ€”Puff of Smoke** 2 (manipulate)

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** You cast _[[Translocate]]_. The space you leave and the one you appear in are filled with puffs of smoke that make anyone within [[Concealed]] until they leave the smoke or the end of your next turn, at which point the smoke dissipates. Strong winds immediately disperse the smoke.
