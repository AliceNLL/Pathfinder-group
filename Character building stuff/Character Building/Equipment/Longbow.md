# Longbow
![[icons-weapons-bows-longbow-recurve-leather-brown.webp|150]]

This 5-foot-tall bow, usually made of a single piece of elm, hickory, or yew, has a powerful draw and is excellent at propelling arrows with great force and at an extreme distance. You must use two hands to fire a longbow, and it can't be used while mounted.
