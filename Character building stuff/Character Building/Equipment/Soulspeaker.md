# Soulspeaker
![[icons-commodities-bones-skull-deformed-white.webp|150]]

This grotesque, amulet-like shrunken head is said to hold a shard of its owner's psyche. The head is often that of a humanoid, but any creature capable of speaking in life can provide the grisly component needed for this magic item's creation. The head can contain a short message whispered to it and can then be commanded to repeat the message later. While a _soulspeaker_ carries a message, the eyes of the shrunken head open, and they close as soon as its message is delivered.

**Activate**2 command

**Effect** You cast _[[Message]]_, but instead of your message being transferred directly to a target's ears, the message is stored in the _soulspeaker_. The _soulspeaker's_ eyes open, and the next time it's activated, the _soulspeaker_ repeats the message you spoke to it with a rasping whisper before its eyes close again, the message expended.
