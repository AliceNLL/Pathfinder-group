# Soul Cage
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-held-items-soul-cage.webp|150]]

As you Craft your _soul cage_, you trap your soul within it, an integral part of the complicated process of becoming a lich. When you're destroyed, your soul flees to the _soul cage_, which rebuilds your undead body over the course of `dice: 1d10` days. Afterward, you manifest next to the _soul cage_, fully healed and in a new body (lacking any equipment you had on your old body). Only destroying your _soul cage_ can prevent you from returning.

You choose the form of your _soul cage_ when you Craft it. A few options include a miniature cage, a ring, an amulet, or a crown. Work with your GM to adjust the usage and Bulk as needed, though a soul cage is rarely more than light Bulk. The soul cage has Hardness 9 and 36 HP.

If your _soul cage_ is destroyed but you aren't, you can attempt to find your soul and trap it again, building a new soul cage. This is no trivial feat and often takes an entire adventure to accomplish. If you don't cage your soul again, you suffer a long decline.
