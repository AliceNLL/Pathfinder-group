# Torrent Snare
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-snares-torrent-snare.webp|150]]

You pile waterlogged plants or access a nearby source of water to rain down on a Medium or smaller creature that enters the snare's square. When a creature enters the square, the snare's square and all adjacent squares become slippery difficult terrain, and the triggering creature must attempt a DC 19 reflex saving throw, with the following effects.

**Success** The target is unaffected.

**Failure** The target falls prone.

**Critical Failure** The target falls prone and is forced into one of the other squares soaked by the snare.
