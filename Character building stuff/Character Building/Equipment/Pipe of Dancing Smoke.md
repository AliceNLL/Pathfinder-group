# Pipe of Dancing Smoke
![[icons-sundries-misc-pipe-elegant.webp|150]]

This ornate pipe is chiseled from a single bloodstone piece with wooden accents. When in use, the pipe gives off a vibrant red smoke that floats lazily in the air. These pipes are popular among bards and braggarts who like the ostentatious smoke it gives offâ€”and who often use it to create raucous diversions or send indiscreet signals.

**Activate** 2 Interact

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** The smoke forms a bird that flies up to 120 feet in a direction of your choice. When it collides with a solid object or travels the full range, whichever is shorter, it explodes in a 20 foot burst of smoke with the effects of _[[Mist]]_.
