![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-consumables-talismans-potency-crystal.webp|150]]

**Activate** F (concentrate)

**Trigger** You make an attack with the affixed weapon, but you haven't rolled yet

* * *

This fluorite crystal glows with a strange phosphorescence. When you activate the crystal, the weapon becomes a _+2 greater striking weapon_ on the Strike and until the end of this turn, gaining a +2 item bonus to the attack roll and increasing the damage to three weapon damage dice.
