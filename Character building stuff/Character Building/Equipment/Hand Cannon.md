# Hand Cannon
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-weapons-hand-cannon.webp|150]]

Popular among privateers and mercenaries in Goka, hand cannons are little more than a hardened tube with a handle and external ignition attached. A hand cannon can be used to fire almost anything that can be packed into its barrel. The wielder of a hand cannon can change the damage type granted by its modular trait as part of the same Interact action used to reload.
