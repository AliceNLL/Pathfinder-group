These bracers are made from plates of durable dawnsilver and gleam like the summer sun.

**Activate** R (manipulate)

**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** A ranged weapon attack hits you but doesn't critically hit

**Requirements** You are aware of the attack and not off-guard

* * *

**Effect** The bracers send the missile off-course. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to AC against the triggering attack. If this would cause the attack to be a failure, the attack misses you.
