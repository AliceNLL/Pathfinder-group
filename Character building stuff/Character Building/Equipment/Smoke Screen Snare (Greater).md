# Smoke Screen Snare (Greater)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-consumable.svg|150]]

You create a snare that releases a dense cloud of smoke when a creature enters the square, filling a specified area. All creatures within that area are [[Concealed]], and all other creatures are concealed to them. The smoke lasts for 1 minute or until dispersed by a strong wind.

The smoke fills a 20 foot burst centered on the snare's square.

**Craft Requirements** Supply a [[Smoke Ball (Greater)|Greater Smokestick]].
