**Effect** You do a quick bit of legerdemain with _The Wanderer_. As the card appears to disappear from your hand, it's immediately replaced by an object of Light bulk in your hand. The object can be any Common permanent magic item, weapon, or piece of gear of a level no higher than your level â€“2. The item exists for 1 minute, or until it is no longer attended by you, at which point the item vanishes and The Wanderer reappears in your possession.
