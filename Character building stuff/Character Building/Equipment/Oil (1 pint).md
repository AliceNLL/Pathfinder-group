# Oil (1 pint)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-adventuring-gear-oil.webp|150]]

You can use oil to fuel lanterns, but you can also set a pint of oil aflame and throw it. You must first spend an Interact action preparing the oil, then throw it with another action as a ranged attack. If you hit, it splatters on the creature or in a single 5-foot square you target. You must succeed at a DC 10 flat for the oil to ignite successfully when it hits. If the oil ignites, the target takes 1d6 fire damage.
