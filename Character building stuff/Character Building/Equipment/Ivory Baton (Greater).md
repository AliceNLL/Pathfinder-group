# Ivory Baton (Greater)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-held-items-ivory-baton.webp|150]]

This white, slender rod bears intricately carved reliefs of magnificent animals that bow and dance to some unseen commander. The baton enables you to command constructs.

* * *

**Activate** 2 command, Interact (enchantment, incapacitation)

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** You take control of a construct. This has the effects of 9th-level _[[Dominate]]_ with a DC of 39, but it affects only constructs. It lacks the mental trait and functions on mindless constructs. It also ignores any golem antimagic the target might have. The effect's duration endsif the baton is destroyed or leaves your possession for at least 1 minute, and you can issue commands to the target only while holding the baton.

* * *

**Activate** 1 Interact

**Frequency** once per round

* * *

**Effect** You closely direct the actions of one construct you control and can see within 60 feet. That construct gains a +1 status bonus to attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws (except saving throws against the ivory baton).
