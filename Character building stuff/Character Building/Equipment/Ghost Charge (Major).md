* * *

These spring-loaded metal canisters contain a mixture of chemicals and salts that drain and disintegrate nearby undead creatures.

A ghost charge gives a +3 item bonus to attack rolls, deals 4d8 vitality damage and 4 vitality splash damage, though as usual for vitality damage, this damage harms only undead and creatures with void healing. A primary target that takes damage from a ghost charge becomes [[Enfeebled 1|Enfeebled 2]] until the start of your next turn.

Ghost charges are designed to explode even on contact with a spiritual substance, making them ideal for damaging incorporeal undead.
