![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-shields-precious-material-shields-mithral-buckler.webp|150]]

Dawnsilver shields are 1 Bulk lighter than normal (or light Bulk if their normal Bulk is 1, with no effect on a shield that normally has light Bulk). When used for a shield bash, they're treated as silver weapons.

The shield has Hardness 6, HP 24, and BT 12.

**Craft Requirements** mithral worth at least 4,000 gp
