# Mask (Ordinary)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-worn-items-other-worn-items-mask.webp|150]]

A mask helps you use the [[Impersonate]] action to pass yourself off as someone you aren't.

This ordinary mask is made out of cheap material, such as paper-mâché or simple cloth. This can be specially fitted over another mask.
