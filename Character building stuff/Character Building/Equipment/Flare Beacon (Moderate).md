Flare beacons create an incredibly bright light for a brief period of time. They are often used to signal others to the beacon's location, to coordinate assaults, to request rescue, or for other similar reasons. Higher-level beacons have a radius so large that they can be seen from miles away at night. When you Activate a flare beacon, you can either place it on the ground in a space within your reach or toss it up to 60 feet straight up. A flare beacon in the air falls at a rate of 10 feet per round.

The beacon shines bright light in a 60-foot radius and dim light in the next 60 feet. Creatures within a 10-foot radius of the beacon must succeed at a DC 20 fortitude save or be dazzled until they are no longer within 10 feet of it.
