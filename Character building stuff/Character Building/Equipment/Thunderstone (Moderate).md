When this stone hits a creature or a hard surface, it explodes with a deafening bang. A thunderstone deals the listed sonic damage and sonic splash damage, and each creature within 10 feet of the space in which the stone exploded must succeed at a DC 20 fortitude saving throw with the listed DC or be [[Deafened]] until the end of its next turn. Many types of thunderstone grant an item bonus to attack rolls.

You gain a +1 item bonus to attack rolls. The bomb deals 2d4 sonic damage and 2 sonic splash damage, and the DC is 20.
