## Traits

**Agile:**

The multiple attack penalty you take with this weapon on the second attack on your turn is –4 instead of –5, and –8 instead of –10 on the third and subsequent attacks in the turn.

**Finesse:**

You can use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier on attack rolls using this melee weapon. You still use your Strength modifier when calculating damage.

**Trip:**

You can use this weapon to [Trip](https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=40) with the [Athletics](https://2e.aonprd.com/Skills.aspx?ID=3) skill even if you don't have a free hand. This uses the weapon's [reach](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=192) (if different from your own) and adds the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Trip using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure.

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [Recall Knowledge](https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=26) checks related to these creature is increased by 2.

  

## Critical Specialization Effects

**Source** [_Core Rulebook pg. 283_](https://2e.aonprd.com/Sources.aspx?ID=1) [4.0](https://2e.aonprd.com/Sources.aspx?ID=1)  
Certain feats, class features, weapon runes, and other effects can grant you additional benefits when you make a Strike with certain weapons and get a critical success. This is called a critical specialization effect. The exact effect depends on which weapon group your weapon belongs to, as listed below. You can always decide not to add the critical specialization effect of your weapon.  
  
**Knife**: The target takes 1d6 [persistent bleed damage](https://2e.aonprd.com/Conditions.aspx?ID=29). You gain an item bonus to this bleed damage equal to the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls.
