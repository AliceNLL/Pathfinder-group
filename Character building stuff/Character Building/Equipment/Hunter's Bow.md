# Hunter's Bow
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-weapons-specific-magic-weapons-hunters-bow.webp|150]]

Stealthy hunters and rogues can use this +1 magic shortbow to attack from hiding. If you use this bow to Strike a target that can't see you and you get a critical hit, the target takes an extra 1d6 piercing damage (this is in addition to sneak attack damage if you're a rogue).
