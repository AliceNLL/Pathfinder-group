# Sphere of Annihilation
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-artifacts-sphere-of-annihilation.webp|150]]

A _sphere of annihilation_ is a floating black sphere that pulls any matter that comes into contact with it into a void, destroying it utterly. Anything or anyone destroyed by the sphere can be brought back only by a deity's direct intervention. The sphere can't be counteracted by dispel magic or similar effects.

The sphere stays entirely still until caused to move by a creature controlling it. Taking control of the sphere requires succeeding at an attempt to activate it. A talisman of the sphere makes it easier to control the sphere.

**Activate** A command

**Requirements** You are within 40 feet of the sphere

* * *

**Effect** You attempt a DC 30 arcana check. If you succeed, you direct the sphere to move up to 10 feet in a straight line (or up to 20 feet on a critical success). On a failure, you lose control of the sphere, and it moves 10 feet closer to you in a straight line (or 20 feet on a critical failure).

**Destruction** When a gate spell is cast such that its rift overlaps a _sphere of annihilation_, roll d%. On a result of 1-50, the sphere is destroyed; on a 51-85, the spell is disrupted; and on a 86-100, everything within an 180 foot emanation of the sphere is pulled to another plane through a tear in the spatial fabric. If a _rod of cancellation_ touches the sphere, both items explode, dealing 14d6 bludgeoning damage (DC 35 Basic reflex save) to everything in a 60 foot burst from the point of their destruction.
