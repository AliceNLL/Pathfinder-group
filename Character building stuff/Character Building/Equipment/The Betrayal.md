# The Betrayal
![[icons-sundries-gaming-playing-cards-grey.webp|150]]

**Suit** Crowns (Cha)

**Alignment** neutral evil

* * *

_The Betrayal_ represents selfishness and envy, twisting outcomes toward unfavorable or even devastating results. As long as _The Betrayal_ is invested, you become more adept at hiding who you really are and tricking targets into positions of vulnerability. You gain a +2 item bonus on Deception checks made to [[Impersonate]] or [[Feint]]. This increases to a +3 bonus if you are at least 17th level.

**Activate** f envision

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** You turn the tables on your foes, bringing one of them into your ranks and compelling them to attack their allies. You cast _[[Dominate]]_ on a creature, but can only issue commands to attack or otherwise harm, betray, or inconvenience its allies. The level of the spell is one-half your level, rounded down (minimum 6th level), and the save DC is your class DC (DC resolve will).
