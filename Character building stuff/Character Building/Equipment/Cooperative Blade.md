# Cooperative Blade
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-weapons-specific-magic-weapons-cooperative-blade.webp|150]]

This _+1 striking longsword_ has a mirror-like blade free of tarnish despite being millennia old.

While wielding it, you gain a +2 item bonus to checks to [[Aid]]. If you're an expert with the skill or attack roll you're using to Aid and you critically succeed, you grant your ally a +3 circumstance bonus to the triggering check instead of a +2 bonus.
