# Fire-Douse Snare
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-consumable.svg|150]]

You carefully pack rare, heat-absorbing powders into a specially prepared clay vessel, then bury the vessel in the ground up to its neck. When a creature enters the square, the vessel's neck shatters, dispersing the powders into the air. The powder instantly douses non-magical fires the size of a campfire or smaller within 10 feet of the snare. The creature triggering the snare must attempt a DC 20 reflex check on the next Interact check. If it fails a second time, it automatically removes the condition with a third Interact action.

**Critical Failure** The creature is blinded for 1 minute and dazzled for 10 minutes afterwards.
