![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-consumables-talismans-conrasu-coin.webp|150]]

**Activate** F envision

**Trigger** You attempt a Diplomacy check to [[Make an Impression]].

These wooden discs sometimes form spontaneously at the Wood Pile, a secret conrasu location suffused with extraplanar energy. A conrasu coin can be activated to call upon the power of a specific type of aeon.

This coin has small wings like an arbiter, the messenger and diplomat aeon. When you activate the coin, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on the Diplomacy check, which increases to a +3 circumstance bonus to Make an Impression on a lawful creature.
