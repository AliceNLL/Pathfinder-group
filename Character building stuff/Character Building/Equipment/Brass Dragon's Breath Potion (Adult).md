# Brass Dragon's Breath Potion (Adult)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-consumables-potions-brass-dragons-breath-potion.webp|150]]

This liquid contains blood from a brass dragon. For 1 hour after you imbibe the concoction, you can unleash a brass dragon's breath weapon. The potency of the breath depends on the potion's type, based on the age of the dragon whose blood was used to make the potion.

Exhaling dragon breath uses a single action. You create a 30 foot line of fire which deals 6d6 fire damage. All creatures in the area must attempt a DC 29 reflex save.

After you use the breath weapon, you can't do so again for 1d4 rounds.
