# Rime Jar
![[icons-consumables-drinks-alcohol-spirits-bottle-blue.webp|150]]

Magical reagents slosh inside this rime-frosted pottery jar the size of a human head. Despite appearing to be rimed in hoarfrost, the jar is warm to the touch. Ilverani wizards create rime jars to sustain themselves during the coldest winter nights.

**Activate** 3 Interact

**Effect** The jar draws off the cold and warms your body. If you have the [[Fatigued]] condition caused by exposure to environmental cold, it removes the condition. For 8 hours after applying the rime, you treat extreme cold as severe cold.
