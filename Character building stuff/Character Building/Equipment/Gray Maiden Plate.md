# Gray Maiden Plate
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-armor-hellknight-plate.webp|150]]

These suits of faceless full plate were first designed and distributed under Queen Ileosa's rule, but today, each new suit of this infamous style of plate armor is made by a Gray Maiden herself or a new member's sponsor.
