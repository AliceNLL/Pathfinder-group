# Adamantine Echo
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-runes-fundamental-armor-runes-armor-potency.webp|150]]

Made from glossy, nearly black adamantine, this large fragment of a plate armor vambrace provides little protection on its own. However, when incorporated into an intact suit of armor, it functions as a +1 armor potency rune.
