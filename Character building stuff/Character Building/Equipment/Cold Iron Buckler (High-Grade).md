![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-shields-precious-material-shields-cold-Iron-buckler.webp|150]]

Cold iron shields don't typically have an additional effect, though when used for a shield bash, they are cold iron weapons.

The shield has Hardness 8, HP 32, and BT 16.

**Craft Requirements** cold iron worth at least 2,500 gp
