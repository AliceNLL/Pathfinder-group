# Poison Concentrator (Major)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-equipment.svg|150]]

This compression apparatus can reduce two poisons into a more concentrated dose. As a 10-minute activity that has the manipulate trait, you can use a poison concentrator to combine two doses of the same alchemical poison of level 18 or lower, creating a single concentrated poison with a +1 item bonus to its DC.
