* * *

This metal grasshopper studded with emeralds is usually clasped to the legs of a suit of armor.

When you activate it, make a [[Leap]], traveling up to 100 feet horizontally and up to 30 feet vertically.

This benefit applies to any other Leaps you make before the end of your turn.

If you don't end your jump on solid ground, you flutter in the air until the end of your turn, then fall harmlessly at a rate of 60 feet per round until you reach the ground.
