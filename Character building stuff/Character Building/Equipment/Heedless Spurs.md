# Heedless Spurs
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-worn-items-other-worn-items-heedless-spurs.webp|150]]

These wicked-looking spiked metal wheels fit around the ankles and jingle when the wearer walks, imposing a -1 item penalty on Stealth checks. If used as a weapon, they are treated as a [[Spiked Gauntlet]].

**Activate** A Interact

**Frequency** once per 10 minutes

**Requirements** You are riding a mount

* * *

**Effect** You kick both spurs into your mount's flank. Your mount takes 2d6 bleed and gains the quickened condition for 1 minute or until the persistent bleed damage ends, whichever comes first. It can use the extra action only to Stride.
