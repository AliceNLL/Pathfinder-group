# Clinging Bubbles (Moderate)
![[icons-magic-water-bubbles-air-water-pink.webp|150]]

This small vial of viscous, clear, soapy solution comes with a wand, attached to the inside of the vial's cap, with a little loop at its end. A vial has enough solution to be used 10 times.

**Activate** 1 Interact

* * *

**Effect** You dip the wand in the solution and blow on it. An improbably large cloud of bubbles emerges in a 5 foot burst. This cloud travels in a straight line, moving 10 feet at the end of your turns. The bubbles are thick and sticky, and any creature who enters the same space as the bubble cloud becomes shrouded in them, taking a â€“10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speed. A creature covered in bubbles can use an Interact action to pop the bubbles and reduce the penalty by 5 feet. The cloud can be redirected with strong winds. The cloud of bubbles has AC 5, 30 Hit Points, and weakness 5 to piercing and slashing. The bubbles pop naturally and harmlessly after 1 minute.
