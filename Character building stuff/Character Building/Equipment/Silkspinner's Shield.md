# Silkspinner's Shield
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-shields-specific-shields-silkspinners-shield.webp|150]]

This oddly fuzzy buckler resembles the abdomen of a spider. Its defensive side is covered in fine hairs, and two small spinnerets protrude from the bottom of its rim. The spinnerets serve as _+2 greater striking shield spikes_.

**Activate** 1 Command

**Frequency** once per day

**Effect** You animate the silkspinner's shield. Eight spider legs sprout from the shield's rim, granting you a climb Speed of 25 feet until the end of your next turn. Additionally, the spinnerets animate and produce silk for 1 minute. Successful shield bash Strikes made with the silkspinner's shield during this time entangle the target in silk. The target takes a -10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds for 1 round. If your Strike was a critical hit, the target becomes [[Immobilized]] for 1 round instead. Regardless, the target can attempt to Escape (DC 30) to end the effect early.
