# Vulture's Wing
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-consumable.svg|150]]

**Activate** A Cast a Spell

* * *

This fan of vulture feathers scatters on an unnatural gust of wind. If this catalyst is used to cast a _[[Enfeeble]]_ spell that has been heightened to at least 5th level, instead of targeting a single creature, you cast the spell in a 30-foot-area cone. You don't make a spell attack roll, instead affecting all creatures within the area with the effect the spell would normally have on a hit. This means creatures within the area must attempt a Fortitude save to determine whether they're enfeebled.
