# Resilient
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-runes-fundamental-armor-runes-armor-potency.webp|150]]

_Resilient_ runes imbue armor with additional protective magic. This grants the wearer a +1 item bonus to saving throws.

You can upgrade the _resilient_ rune already etched on a suit of armor using the normal process for upgrading items and runes.
