# Wand of Dumbfounding Doom (9th-level)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-equipment.svg|150]]

Carvings of skulls, monsters, and all manner of violence decorate this wand of blackened bone, but it makes absurd sounds when Activated, such as a honking horn, a manic giggle, or a daydreamy sigh.

**Activate** Cast a Spell

**Frequency** once per day, plus overcharge

* * *

**Effect** You cast 9th-level _[[Impending Doom]]_, showing the target a potential death that's gruesome and absurd. If the target becomes [[Frightened]] by the spell, it also becomes [[Stupefied]] with a value 1 higher than the frightened value. This lasts for the duration of the spell.

* * *

**Craft Requirements** Supply a casting of _[[Impending Doom]]_ of the appropriate level.
