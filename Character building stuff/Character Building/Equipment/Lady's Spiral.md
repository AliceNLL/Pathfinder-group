# Lady's Spiral
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-weapons-specific-magic-weapons-ladys-spiral.webp|150]]

This _+1 [[Vitalizing|Disrupting]] striking whip_ has a single strip of anointed leather wrapped around its hilt in a spiral pattern. The handle of the whip ends in an oak spike that has been sanctified with ashes from Pharasma's Boneyard. If the spike is used to stake a vampire that's vulnerable to being staked, the vampire is immediately destroyed, without having to sever its head and anoint it with holy water. If the whip is buried with a creature, that creature can't rise as an undead as long as the whip remains by its side.
