# Dreadsmoke Thurible
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-held-items-dreadsmoke-thurible.webp|150]]

This black-and-gray thurible is decorated with a skeleton motif; the jaw of one of the decorative skulls unhinges, allowing you to load it with incense as an action. A long, thin chain is connected to the top of the thurible.

**Activate** D Interact; **Cost** incense worth at least 5 gp

* * *

**Effect** You swing the thurible around you, spreading inky black smoke in a 20 foot emanation that has the effect of _[[Mist]]_. Undead creatures can see through the smoke as if it didn't exist. Void energy also disrupts the magic of the smoke; anyone who uses a void effect, along with creatures affected by a void effect, can see through the smoke for 1 round.
