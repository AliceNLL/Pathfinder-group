The burnished red faces of djezet-alloy shields attract effects made of pure magic.

While you have a djezet shield Raised, you can use the [[Shield Block]] reaction when you would take energy damage in addition to the reaction's usual trigger. When taking energy damage from a spell, the shield's listed Hardness doubles.

**Craft Requirements** djezet worth at least 75 gp
