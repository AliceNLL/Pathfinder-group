# Ashen (Greater)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-runes-weapon-property-runes-weapon-property-runes.webp|150]]

In his attempts to recreate the initial feeling of the object he encountered ages ago, the Ash Engineer discovered a different effect, one that would confound his enemies. Ashen weapons are typically coated in a thin layer of ash that gradually returns over the span of a day, even after wiping away. A creature hit by an attack from an ashen weapon becomes surrounded by burning ash, which deals 1d8 persistent,fire damage. This ash clouds the senses, causing the creature to become [[Confused]] for 1 round unless it succeeds at a DC 35 will save. On a critical failure, the effect lasts for 1 minute.
