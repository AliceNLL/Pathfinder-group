# Razmiri Wayfinder
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-worn-items-other-worn-items-wayfinder.webp|150]]

Worn on a chain around the neck, a Razmiri wayfinder functions as a compass and provides its wearer a +1 item bonus to Deception checks to Lie or Impersonate. Razmiri wayfinders can also be used to grant temporary healing, making it easier for the wearer to impersonate a divine spellcaster.

**Activate** 1 envision

**Frequency** three times per day

**Effect** You touch an adjacent creature, granting them 3d8 temporary Hit Points for 1 hour.

**Frequency** once per day

**Effect** You touch an adjacent creature and attempt a counteract check against one poison or disease afflicting the creature. On a success, you halt the effects of the poison or disease for 1 day, rather than removing it. This temporarily relieves any penalties imposed by the affliction but doesn't cure the effect or count against its duration; the poison or disease is merely halted for a time, and it resumes where it left off once this effect ends.
