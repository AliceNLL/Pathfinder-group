# Hongrui's Gratitude
![[icons-equipment-back-cloak-hooded-red.webp|150]]

Given as thanks for honoring the memories of three unfortunate travelers who met a tragic end in the Willowshore Hinterlands, this red-hooded cloak is decorated with an image of an elaborately dressed performer whose two companions hold a lantern and umbrella for her.

**Activate** 3 command, envision, Interact (evocation, light)

**Frequency** once per day

**Requirements** You don't have the umbrella activation of this cloak active

**Effect** With a wave of the cloak to the left, you cause the image of the lantern-holding companion on the cloak to vanish. A floating red lantern appears at your side and follows you at an arm's length while casting bright light in a 20-foot radius (and dim light for the next 20 feet) like a torch. For 1 hour, while the light from this lantern is active, you gain a +1 item bonus to Diplomacy checks. You can Activate the cloak again to dismiss the torch.
