# War Lance
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-weapons-lance.webp|150]]

This lance appears shorter and stockier in comparison to other weapons of its type. The war lance most notably features shielding integrated into its vamplate, exchanging its reach for a sturdier base when defending against attacks or attempting to overpower an opponent.
