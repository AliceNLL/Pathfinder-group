# Aligned Oil
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-consumables-oils-aligned-oil.webp|150]]

**Activate** A Interact

This oil fills a weapon with cosmic power of an alignment. Each aligned oil is crafted to one alignment: chaos, evil, good, or law (such as a good-aligned oil). A weapon anointed with this oil gains the effects of the property rune matching its alignment: [[Anarchic]] (chaos), [[Axiomatic]] (law), [[Holy]] (good), or [[Unholy]] (evil). This lasts for 1 minute.
