# Maw of Hungry Shadows
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-equipment.svg|150]]

Shadows swirl around this soot-black tome, swallowing up any light that touches them. A faint whispering emanates from the grimoire's pages when opened.

**Activate**1 envision

**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** Your last action was to cast a spell prepared from this grimoire that has the shadow trait

* * *

**Effect** Your shadow, and that of the tome, elongates and reaches hungrily for one foe within 30 feet, who must attempt a Fortitude save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature is [[Blinded]] for 1 round and [[Drained 1]] as the shadows scrape across it.

**Failure** The creature is blinded for 1 minute and [[Drained 1|Drained 2]] as the shadows seize it.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but the shadows also pull the creature into the tome, teleporting it to the Shadow Plane.
