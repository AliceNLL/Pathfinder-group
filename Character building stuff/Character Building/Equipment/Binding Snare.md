# Binding Snare
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-snares-binding-snare.webp|150]]

When a creature enters the snare's square, several strands of strong wires ending in jagged hooks latch onto it before hauling it to the ground. The snare deals 2d6 piercing damage, and the targeted creature must attempt a DC 28 reflex save.

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature takes half damage.

**Failure** The creature takes full damage and is knock [[Prone]] and [[Immobilized]] for 1 round (Escape DC 28).

**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage, is knocked prone, and is [[Restrained]] for 1 round (Escape DC 28).
