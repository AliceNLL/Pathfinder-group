# Violin of the Waves
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-equipment.svg|150]]

This violin is crafted from finely wrought rosewood that emits a strong, but pleasant, smell of salt water and ocean life. It's engraved with images of sailors working and waves gently rolling. When you make a Performance check using the _violin of the waves_, you gain a +2 item bonus to the check. This bonus increases to +3 if the performer is currently aboard a ship, walking on the ocean, or otherwise immediately adjacent to ocean water.

The violin was created to play a specific tune, one that springs instantly into the mind of anyone who so much as casually strums the instrument. It's a tune of calm waters and safety, but also of pranks played upon shipmates and revelry.
