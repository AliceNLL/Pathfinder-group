# Bewitching Bloom (Bellflower)
![[icons-magic-symbols-arrowhead-green.webp|150]]

While dormant, this tattoo appears to be a simple flower bud, but when activated the flower swiftly blossoms, remaining that way until the next time you make your daily preparations. These blooms are colorful, elegant representations of bellflowers.

**Activate**2 envision

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** Choose a willing ally you can see within 30 feet. A need for freedom trills through your ally's blood. Until the end of that ally's next turn, they gain a +2 status bonus to rolls to recover from the [[Confused]], frightened, [[Grabbed]], [[Paralyzed]], and [[Restrained]] conditions. When you Activate the bloom, the target can attempt a new save against a condition the bonus applies to, or they can use a reaction to attempt to [[Escape]] being grabbed, [[Immobilized]], or restrained, provided such an attempt is allowed.
