# Elder Sign
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-artifacts-elder-sign.webp|150]]

This stone tablet is carved with the symbol of a five-branched twig. There are only a limited number of elder signs, and each time one is destroyed, the universe's doom creeps inexorably closer. Reciting one of three different occult mantras (DC 20 occultism check to do so correctly) allows three different activations. All three abilities work only on a creature connected to the Elder Mythos or a cosmic horror, such as a wendigo or gug; the activations refer to them as "eldritch creatures."

**Activate** D command, envision, Interact

* * *

**Effect** The _elder sign_ casts a 10th-level banishment spell on an eldritch creature. Even if the creature isn't extraplanar, the _elder sign_ can still banish it, sending it back to the part of the Material Plane from which it originated. If the creature is a Great Old One, the _elder sign_ banishes it automatically (as if it critically failed its save) but is then forever destroyed.

**Activate** D command, envision, Interact

**Effect** The _elder sign_ casts dispel magic on an effect from an eldritch creature, using a counteract level of 10 and +30 modifier for the roll.

**Activate** D command, envision, Interact

**Effect** The _elder sign_ casts dimensional lock, though it wards against travel by only eldritch creatures. Each time the _elder sign_ casts _dimensional lock_ in this way, the previous _dimensional lock_ spell ends.

**Destruction** The only way to destroy an _elder sign_ is to use it to banish a Great Old One.
