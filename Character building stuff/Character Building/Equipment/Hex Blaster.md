# Hex Blaster
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-weapons-specific-magic-weapons-hex-blaster.webp|150]]

This _+2 striking fearsome arquebus_ is composed of warped and twisted wood engraved with eerie runes. When the weapon fires, the blast sometimes sounds like the cackling of a diabolical witch.

**Activate** 1 command

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** You afflict a creature you can see with a hex of impending doom. The hex lasts for 1 minute. As long as the creature is hexed, when you hit it with a round from the hex blaster, the creature must attempt a DC 28 will save at the end of your turn; the creature attempts a single Will save regardless of the number of times you hit it.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature is [[Frightened|Frightened 1]]. It also takes 1d6 persistent,mental damage.

**Failure** The creature is [[Frightened|Frightened 2]]. It also takes 2d6 persistent,mental damage.

**Critical Failure** The creature is frightened 2 and [[Slowed]] for 1 minute. It also takes 4d6 persistent,mental damage and is cursed with a hex of impending doom. If the target falls [[Unconscious]] from damage dealt by this Strike or the persistent mental damage, it remains unconscious for 1 day or until this curse is removed. After 1 day, if the creature is still unconscious, it must succeed at a DC 28 fortitude save or die; this effect has the death and incapacitation traits.
