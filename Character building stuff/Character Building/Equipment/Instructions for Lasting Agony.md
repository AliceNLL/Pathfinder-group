# Instructions for Lasting Agony
![[icons-sundries-books-book-face-black.webp|150]]

This worn and stained manual emits a chill when opened.

* * *

**Activate** 1 envision (metamagic)

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** If your next action is to cast a harmful necromancy spell that you prepared from this grimoire and that allows a saving throw, you warp and twist void energy into the spell to cause intense pain. If the target fails its saving throw against the spell, it becomes [[Sickened 1]] by the pain.
