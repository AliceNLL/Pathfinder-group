# The Cyclone
![[icons-sundries-gaming-playing-cards-grey.webp|150]]

**Suit** Hammers (Str)

**Alignment** chaotic evil

* * *

_The Cyclone_ represents tumultuous evil plots. As long as it is invested, _The Cyclone_ bolsters you with helpful winds that grant you a +2 item bonus to Athletics checks made to [[Climb]], [[High Jump]], [[Long Jump]], and [[Disarm]]. This increases to a +3 item bonus if you are at least 17th level.

**Activate** 2 envision, Interact

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** You cast _[[Whirlwind]]_. You do not treat the squares in the whirlwind as difficult terrain, but all other creatures do. The level of the spell is one-half your level, rounded down (minimum 8th level), and the save DC is your class DC or spell DC (DC resolve reflex).
