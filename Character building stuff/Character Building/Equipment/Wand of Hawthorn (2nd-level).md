# Wand of Hawthorn (2nd-level)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-equipment.svg|150]]

Carved from a hawthorn branch, this wand has a smooth handle, but the shaft remains covered in bark and long thorns. Polished red stones, arranged like a cluster of berries, decorate the pommel.

**Activate** Cast a Spell

**Frequency** once per day, plus overcharge

* * *

**Effect** You cast 2nd-level _[[Oaken Resilience]]_, and the target sprouts long thorns like those of a hawthorn tree. While _[[Oaken Resilience]]_ lasts, any creature that hits the target with an unarmed Strike or otherwise touches it takes 1d4 piercing damage from the thorns. A creature that has engulfed or swallowed the target takes this damage as well at the start of each of the target's turns.

* * *

**Craft Requirements** Supply a casting of _[[Oaken Resilience]]_ of the appropriate level.
