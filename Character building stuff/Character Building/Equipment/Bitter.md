# Bitter
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-runes-armor-property-runes-armor-property-runes.webp|150]]

While you wear this acrid armor, any creature that Engulfs you or Swallows you Whole is [[Sickened 1]]; if it spends an action retching to reduce the sickened condition, you can attempt to Escape as a reaction.
