# Madcap Top
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-consumables-other-consumables-chimera-thread.webp|150]]

This top has 20 divisions, painted in a chaotic mess of clashing colors. When spun, the top quickly settles on a side and generates a strange magical effect based on the side that lands face-up.

**Activateâ€”Spin the Top** 2 (concentrate, manipulate)

* * *

**Effect** Choose a creature within 60 feet to target and roll a d20 on the table below to determine the top's effect. You make any decisions for a spell cast by the top unless otherwise indicated, except that it must target the creature you chose, or the creature you chose must be the center of the spell's area, if it has an area but no targets. If the spell's range is less than 60 feet, increase the range to 60 feet.

Any spell DC required is DC 27, and any spell attack roll required is +17. If the top casts a spell on you, you don't get a saving throw or other defense against it.

The top can't be activated again for `dice: 1d4` hours.
