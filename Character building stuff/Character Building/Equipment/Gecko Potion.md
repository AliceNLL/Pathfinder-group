A _gecko potion_ is a sticky, tawny brown liquid with flecks of sand suspended in it. For 5 minutes after drinking this potion, your fingertips sprout thousands of microscopic, bristled hairs that cling to objects, granting you gain a +1 item bonus to [[Climb]] and [[Palm an Object]] checks and to your Reflex DC against [[Disarm]] attempts.
