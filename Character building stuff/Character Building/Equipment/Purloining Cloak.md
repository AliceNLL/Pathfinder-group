Each purloining cloak is a mercurial mantle once worn by a legendary thief or two. The cloak became infused with a daredevil spirit and a penchant for high-stakes thievery. If its owner isn't willing to partake in such activities, the cloak tries to convince them to sell or give it to someone who will. A purloining cloak can use tendrils of its cloth to attempt Thievery checks to Palm an Object or [[Steal]], proudly offering you its loot later. In addition to those of a mercurial mantle, a purloining cloak has the following activations.

**Activate** 2 command, envision

**Effect** The cloak casts 2nd-level _[[Illusory Disguise]]_ on you, usually to your specifications. However the cloak can choose the appearance of the illusion for you.
