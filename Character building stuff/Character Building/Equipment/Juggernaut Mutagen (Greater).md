After you drink this mutagen, your body becomes thick and sturdy. You exhibit a healthy glow, though you tend to be ponderous and unobservant.

**Benefit** You gain a +3 item bonus to Fortitude saves and 30 temporary Hit Points. Whenever you are at maximum Hit Points for at least 1 full minute, you regain the temporary Hit Points. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead.

**Drawback** You take a -2 penalty to Will saves, Perception checks and initiative rolls.

**Duration** 1 hour.
