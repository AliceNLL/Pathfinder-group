# Unbreakable Heart
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-tattoos-unbreakable-heart.webp|150]]

The name of your beloved adorns this stylized image of a heart. An unbreakable heart tattoo can be received only at the end of a successful _[[Heartbond]]_ ritual, serving as your token. The other participant can have a token other than a tattoo if they wish. If you have more than one heartbond, each unbreakable heart you have serves as a token for only one of them. The love exuding from you grants you a +1 item bonus to Diplomacy checks. When you use heartbond's activity to learn your beloved's present state, you can also grant them a small gift, choosing from the following options each time. Make your choice after learning their state.

*   Your beloved gains 5 temporary Hit Points that last for 10 minutes.
*   The tattoo casts _[[Guidance]]_on your beloved.
*   The tattoo casts _[[Stabilize]]_on your beloved.
*   The tattoo casts _[[Light]]_ on your beloved's token from heartbond.
