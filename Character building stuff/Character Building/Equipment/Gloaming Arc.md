# Gloaming Arc
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-weapons-scimitar.webp|150]]

This black _+2 striking scimitar_ reflects light only along its edge, like a thin crescent moon. It grants a +1 item bonus to Stealth while you're holding it, increasing to a +2 item bonus if it has a _+3 weapon potency_ rune.

**Activate** 3 envision, Interact

**Frequency** once per day

**Effect** Attempt a melee Strike with the gloaming arc. On a hit, you slice away the target's shadow from its body and it must attempt a DC 30 fortitude save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target is [[Enfeebled 1]] for 1 round.

**Failure** The target is [[Enfeebled 1|Enfeebled 2]] for 1 minute and [[Drained 1]]. The target doesn't cast a shadow until it is no longer drained.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but [[Drained 1|Drained 2]].
