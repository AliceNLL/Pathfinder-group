# Ring of Minor Arcana
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-worn-items-other-worn-items-ring-of-minor-arcana.webp|150]]

This rose-gold ring is adorned in the center by a somewhat ominous-looking horned skull. This ring gives you the power to cast the following innate arcane cantrips any number of times each day: _[[Detect Magic]]_, _[[Telekinetic Hand]]_, and _[[Prestidigitation]]_. Each is cast as a 1st-level spell. If you are an arcane spellcaster, these can instead be heightened to the level of your cantrips.
