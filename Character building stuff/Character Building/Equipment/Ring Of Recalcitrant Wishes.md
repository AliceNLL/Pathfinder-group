# Ring Of Recalcitrant Wishes
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-worn-items-other-worn-items-ring-of-maniacal-devices.webp|150]]

This band of interwoven gold and copper, traced with Aklo symbols, is topped with a gleaming, luminescent opal gently bleeding wisps of shadowstuff.

**Activate** 3 command

* * *

**Effect** You attempt to make the ring cast an arcane _[[Wish]]_ spell. However, if the ring doesn't deem the wish to be sufficiently selfless, the wish isn't cast and the ring can't be activated for 24 hours.

You are [[Drained 1|Drained 3]], whether or not the ring refuses the wish.

* * *

Once the wish is cast, the Ring of Recalcitrant Wishes has no powers, though it is rumored that the wearer's death in an act of profound self-sacrifice restores the wish to the ring.
