![[icons-equipment-chest-breastplate-layered-steel.webp|150]]

Hellknights wear a variety of armors decorated with designs specific to the order. Hellknight breastplate serves those in the order who lack the training to wear heavy armor.

A character who is a member of the Hellknights has access to these uncommon armors.
