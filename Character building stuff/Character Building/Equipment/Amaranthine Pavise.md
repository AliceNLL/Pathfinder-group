# Amaranthine Pavise
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-shields-specific-shields-amaranthine-pavise.webp|150]]

This tower shield was developed by followers of Ketephys, the elven god of the hunt. It's distinct for having a central ridge, and for being made from only wood and hide. AC increases to +4 if you are using the [[Take Cover]] action.

Ketephys's religious symbol, a hawk rising over a silver crescent, is painted on the hide stretched across the front of the shield. Each amaranthine pavise is blessed by Ketephysian priests to aid in liberating Tanglebriar and defeating the nascent demon lord Treerazer. While you have the shield raised, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saving throws against the innate spells and special abilities of demons. When your allies have cover from the amaranthine pavise, the circumstance bonus they gain from cover to Reflex saves against area effects also applies to Fortitude and Will saves against demons' area effects.
