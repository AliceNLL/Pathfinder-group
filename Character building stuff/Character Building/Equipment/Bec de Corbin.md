![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-weapons-bec-de-corbin.webp|150]]

A bec de corbin is a spiked polearm that uses a hammer head to help balance the spike. The hammer portion can be used as a secondary striking surface, while the spike or fluke is specially designed to punch through armor and shields.
