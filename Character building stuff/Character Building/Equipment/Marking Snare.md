# Marking Snare
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-snares-marking-snare.webp|150]]

This snare is often used to mark intruders for later tracking or identification. When you create this snare, you must decide whether to make it a dye or a scent marker. Either type of marking grants a +2 circumstance bonus to Track the creature for up to 24 hours or until the dye or scent is washed off (requiring at least a gallon of water and 10 minutes of scrubbing). A creature that enters a square of the snare must attempt a DC 17 reflex save.

**Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Failure** The snare marks the creature.

**Critical Failure** The snare marks the creature, and the creature is blinded until the end of its next turn.
