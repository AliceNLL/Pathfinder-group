# Gravemist Taper

**Activate** Cast a Spell

A _gravemist taper_ is a conical candle with symbols of terror and death carved into the wax. The taper can be used as a catalyst when casting an _[[Mist]]_ spell, burning the taper away, coloring the mist gray, and filling the mist with ghastly, shadowy shapes. The flat check to overcome the [[Concealed]] state from the mist rises to 7, and a creature who fails such a check becomes [[Frightened|Frightened 1]]. This aspect of the spell has the emotion, fear, and mental traits.
