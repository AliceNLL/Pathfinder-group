# Rune of Sin (Gluttony)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-tattoos-rune-of-sin.webp|150]]

This jagged glyph, the gluttony Thassilonian rune of sin, reacts to necromancy magic. When you Cast a necromancy Spell, you gain resistance 5 to damage from spells until the start of your next turn. This resistance is increased to 7 against necromancy spells.
