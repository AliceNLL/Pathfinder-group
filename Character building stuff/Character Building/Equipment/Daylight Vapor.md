# Daylight Vapor
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-alchemical-items-alchemical-poisons-daylight-vapor.webp|150]]

**Activate** 1 Interact

This heavier-than-air mist emits a soft glow. While this poison lasts, it causes its victims to shine from within with agonizing, brilliant radiance. This effect has the light trait (although the poison itself doesn't, so only the light effect can be counteracted by darkness effects). The [[Sickened 1|Sickened]] condition from daylight vapor can't be removed while the poison lasts, and when the victim enters an area of magical darkness, the poison attempts to counteract the darkness with a counteract modifier of +21. If the poison fails, it can't attempt to counteract the same darkness again.
