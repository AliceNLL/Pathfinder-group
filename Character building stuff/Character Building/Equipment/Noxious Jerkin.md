![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-armor-specific-magic-armor-noxious-jerkin.webp|150]]

This +2 resilient padded armor is woven from many strands of gut cord strung with dried organs and preserved xulgath scent glands. When worn, it infuses your body with a ghastly and nauseating flavor.

**Activate** F envision

**Trigger** You are grabbed or are hit by an unarmed attack

* * *

**Effect** Your attacker must attempt a DC 28 Fortitude saving throw. Creatures with a stench aura, such as otyughs and xulgaths, are immune to this effect.

**Success** The creature is unaffected and is immune to the effects of the noxious jerkin for 1 minute.

**Failure** The creature is sickened 1.

**Critical Failure** The creature is sickened 1 and is slowed 1 for 1 round.
