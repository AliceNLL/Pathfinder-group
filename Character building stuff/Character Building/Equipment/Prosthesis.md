# Prosthesis
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-worn-items-other-worn-items-basic-prothesis.webp|150]]

A prosthesis replaces a missing or damaged body part. Typical prostheses include artificial feet, eyes, hands, and limbs, though a basic prosthesis can be designed as a replacement for any body part. Advancements in the prosthetic field mean that even the most basic of prostheses can provide the full range of functionality for a missing body part.

A prosthesis has a number of belts or cuffs that keep it attached to your body. You can attach or remove a prosthesis as an Interact action.
