# Magnetic Construction Set
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-held-items-magnetic-construction-set.webp|150]]

This collection of small magnets and metal rods comes in a wooden box. The magnets are strong enough to firmly cling to metal objects but too weak to move or suspend them. The metal rods are a quarter of an inch in diameter and vary in length from 3 to 6 inches. If connected with the magnets, these rods can be used to build flimsy shapes and structures, which collapse if external weight or pressure is applied.
