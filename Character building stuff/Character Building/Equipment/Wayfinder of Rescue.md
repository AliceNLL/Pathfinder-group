# Wayfinder of Rescue
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-worn-items-other-worn-items-wayfinder.webp|150]]

As a standard [[Wayfinder]], but once per day you can activate it to cast _[[Heal]]_ on a creature other than yourself, using either the one-action or two-action version of heal as a 1st-level spell.
