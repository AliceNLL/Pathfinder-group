# Ring of Spell Turning
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-worn-items-other-worn-items-ring-of-spell-turning.webp|150]]

This golden ring has three diamonds set into its face.

**Activate** R envision

**Trigger** You are targeted by a spell

* * *

**Effect** The ring replicates the effects of an 8th-level _[[Spell Turning]]_ with a counteract modifier of `dice: 1d20+35`, possibly causing the triggering spell to reflect back on its caster.

The ring can reflect no more than 9 total levels of spells per day. If you activate the ring to reflect a spell that would exceed this limit, the attempt fails, but the attempted usage of the ring does not count toward the daily limit.
