# Grave Token
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-consumable.svg|150]]

**Activate** A envision

* * *

This simple charm is made from compacted grave dirt infused with bone dust. A _[[Harm]]_ spell that's empowered by this catalyst can reach faraway targets. If the harm spell is cast with 1 action, its range is 30 feet; if it's cast with 2 actions, its range is 60 feet. This has no effect on the three-action area version of _[[Harm]]_, though in most cases, you don't have enough actions to Activate the token and cast a three-action _[[Harm]]_ anyway.
