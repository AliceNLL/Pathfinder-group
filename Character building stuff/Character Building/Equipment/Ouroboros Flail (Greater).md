# Ouroboros Flail (Greater)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-weapons-specific-magic-weapons-ouroboros-flail.webp|150]]

You can easily expand and contract the chain of this _+3 greater striking greater extending war flail_. It magically grows new links when extended and loses them when contracted.

* * *

**Activate** r command

**Frequency** once per hour

**Trigger** You successfully Strike with the flail while activating its extending rune

* * *

**Effect** The head of the flail wraps around the target of the triggering Strike and drags it in your direction. The target must succeed at a DC 37 fortitude save or be pulled adjacent to you. A creature pulled in is then [[Grabbed]] by the flail until the end of your next turn unless you move, your target Escapes (DC 37), or you use the flail.

* * *

**Activate** 3 Interact

* * *

**Effect** You extend the flail's chain, then wrap it across itself and strike two links together. This severs a usable 120-foot loop of chain from the flail, which instantly returns to its normal length. If you use this activation again, any previous chain you created with it disappears after 1 round. As with most obviously magical and temporary constructs, the chain cannot be sold.
