# Glue Bullet
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-consumables-ammunition-glue-bullet.webp|150]]

**Ammunition** round

**Activate** 1 Interact

These cartridges are filled with sticky clear glue. When a glue bullet hits, a syrupy webbing coats the target and sticks to the ground or a nearby surface, hindering their movement. The target takes a -10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds for 2d4 rounds, or until it Escapes against a DC of 18. On a critical hit, the target is also [[Immobilized]] until it Escapes.
