# Presentable
![[icons-commodities-treasure-token-runed-os-grey.webp|150]]

A garment with this rune is always clean, as though it had just been affected by _[[Prestidigitation]]_. You gain a +1 item bonus to [[Make an Impression]] on those who would be impressed by a particular _presentable_ outfit while wearing this garment.
