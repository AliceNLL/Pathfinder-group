# Wand of Shardstorm (5th-Rank Spell)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-wands-specialty-wands-wand-of-manifold-missiles.webp|150]]

This wand features a carved dragon's head at its top and a polished metal sphere set in its midsection.

**Activate** Cast a Spell

**Frequency** Once per day, plus overcharge

* * *

**Effect** You cast _[[Force Barrage]]_ at 5th rank.

After you cast the spell, an additional shard or shards are released from the wand at the start of each of your turns, as though you cast the 1-action version of _force barrage_. Choose targets each time. This lasts for 1 minute, until you're no longer wielding the wand, or until you try to activate the wand again.

**Craft Requirements** Supply a casting of _force barrage_ of the appropriate rank.
