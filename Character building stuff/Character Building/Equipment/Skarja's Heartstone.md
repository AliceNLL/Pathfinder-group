# Skarja's Heartstone
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-worn-items-other-worn-items-heartstone.webp|150]]

This pale gemstone grants its wearer a +2 item bonus to saving throws and the ability to discern a target's alignment (as _[[Detect Alignment]]_, but can detect chaotic, evil, good, and lawful auras simultaneously) at will by peering through the gemstone.

Like all hag _heartstones_, this gemstone is powered by Skarja's spirit. Skarja does not need to wear her _heartstone_ to benefit from its powers, but she cannot use them if she hasn't touched her _heartstone_ in the past 7 days. If Skarja's _heartstone_ is separated from her for more than 7 days (or if she's been dead for 7 days), it becomes a non-magical gemstone.

_**Note:** Item is worth 1000 gp when non-magical_

Skarja's _heartstone_ allows her to use additional occult innate spells: _[[Ethereal Jaunt]]_ (9th level) and _[[Seize Soul]]_ at will, _[[Shadow Blast]]_ (6th level) twice per day, and _[[Spirit Blast]]_ once per day.
