# Waffle Iron (Mithral)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-adventuring-gear-waffle-iron-mithral.webp|150]]

This set of hinged metal plates features studs on the inside of each plate to provide a texture for the pastry cakes you cook with it. You pour batter on the plates, close the device, and place it on a fire or stove to cook.

The plates of this waffle iron are made of standard-grade mithral rather than iron and might bear an imprint on the plates. As with other mithral cookware, food rarely sticks to a mithral waffle iron. As it's made of mithral, this is an uncommon item.
