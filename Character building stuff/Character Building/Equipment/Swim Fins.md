# Swim Fins
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-adventuring-gear-swim-fins.webp|150]]

These flippers attach to your feet like tight shoes-donning or removing them requires three Interact actions. While worn, you gain a +5-foot item bonus to the distance you move when rolling Athletics to Swim, not when using a swim Speed, and you take a -10-foot item penalty to your Speed.
