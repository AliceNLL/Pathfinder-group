![[icons-sundries-books-book-turquoise-moon.webp|150]]

This pamphlet-sized book records the various symbols seen on fulu and also contains some ready-made magic on a special page that restores itself every day at sunrise. Using the compendium as a reference grants a +2 item bonus to any skill checks to determine a fulu's function or authenticity.

**Effect** You rip a page from the fulu compendium and cast it in a wide arc; as it flies in that arc, it multiplies into a storm of fulus. All undead creatures in a 30 foot emanation are affected by a [[Spirit-Sealing Fulu]] with a DC 25 will save DC of 25.
