# Infernal Health
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-contracts-infernal-contracts-infernal-health.webp|150]]

You regain triple the normal number of Hit Points when resting (meaning you regain triple your Constitution modifier multiplied by your level). The healing you gain from long-term rest is similarly tripled. Once per day, from any distance, Abrogail Thrune II can recite a voidability clause in your Thrune contract as a 1-minute activity to prevent you from regaining Hit Points from resting for 1 day.

**Activate** 1 Command

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** You recite a subclause regarding mandatory remediation from your Thrune contract. For 6 rounds, at the start of your turn each round, you recover 25 Hit Points unless you took spirit damage since the start of your previous turn.
