# Thousand-Pains Fulu (Burl)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-consumables-fulus-fulu-fancy.webp|150]]

**Duration** 1 minute

Created by a chirurgeon who threw away morality in search of endless life, a _thousand-pains fulu_ blocks the natural flow of elements in the body. A creature to which the fulu is affixed must attempt a DC 35 fortitude. Failure or critical failure primes the target for persistent damage triggered by a specific condition that must be met within the fulu's duration.

Though this green fulu looks inviting, it has a foreboding aura. The fulu deals 10d8 poison, causing the target's body to respond adversely to their ki. On a failure or critical failure, if the target takes fire damage, it takes 2d8 persistent,poison as well. These effects have the poison trait.
