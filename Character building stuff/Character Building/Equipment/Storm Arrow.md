# Storm Arrow
![[systems-pf2e-icons-equipment-consumables-ammunition-storm-arrow.webp|150]]

**Activate** A Interact

The head of this arrow is made from gleaming copper.

When an activated _storm arrow_ hits a target, it is buffeted by raging winds and struck by a bolt of lightning that deals 3d12 electricity damage and the target must attempt a DC 25 reflex saving throw.

If this arrow is shot from a weapon with a _shock_ property rune, the save DC increases to 27, though the attack doesn't benefit from the _shock_ property rune itself.

* * *

**Critical Success** The foe is unaffected.

**Success** The foe takes half damage and isn't affected by the wind.

**Failure** The foe takes full damage and is buffeted by winds for 1 round, taking a -2 circumstance penalty to ranged attack rolls and a -10-foot circumstance penalty to its fly Speed.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but the foe takes double damage.
