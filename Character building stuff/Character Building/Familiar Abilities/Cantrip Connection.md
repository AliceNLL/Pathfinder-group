# Cantrip Connection
![[systems-pf2e-icons-actions-Passive.webp|150]]

You can prepare an additional cantrip, or if you have a repertoire, designate a cantrip to add to your repertoire every time you select this ability; you can retrain it but can't otherwise change it. You must be able to prepare cantrips or add them to your repertoire to select this.
