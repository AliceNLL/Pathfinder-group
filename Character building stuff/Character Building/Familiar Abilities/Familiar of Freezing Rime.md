# Familiar of Freezing Rime
![[systems-pf2e-icons-actions-Passive.webp|150]]

Your familiar is cold to the touch, its breath always visible. When you Cast or Sustain a hex, you can cause ice to form in a 5 foot burst centered on a square of your familiar's space. Those squares are difficult terrain until the start of your next turn.
