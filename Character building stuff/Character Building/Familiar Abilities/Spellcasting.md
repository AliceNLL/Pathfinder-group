# Spellcasting
![[systems-pf2e-icons-actions-Passive.webp|150]]

Choose a spell in your repertoire or that you prepared today at least 5 levels lower than your highest-rank spell slot. Your familiar can Cast that Spell once per day using your magical tradition, spell attack modifier, and spell DC. If the spell has a drawback that affects the caster, both you and your familiar are affected. You must be able to cast 6th-rank spells using spell slots to select this.
