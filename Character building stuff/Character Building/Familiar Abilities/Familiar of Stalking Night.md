# Familiar of Stalking Night
![[systems-pf2e-icons-actions-Passive.webp|150]]

Your familiar is dark of fur or feather, and light seems to disappear into it. When you Cast or Sustain a hex, and your familiar is adjacent to an enemy to which it's [[Concealed]], [[Hidden]], or undetected, the enemy becomes [[Frightened|Frightened 1]].
