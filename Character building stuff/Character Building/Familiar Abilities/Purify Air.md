# Purify Air
![[systems-pf2e-icons-actions-Passive.webp|150]]

Prerequisites [[Leshy Familiar Secrets]]

Your familiar recycles air, providing enough oxygen for a Medium creature in areas with stale air, such as a sealed chamber or extradimensional space. If the leshy is within the area of an inhaled poison effect or an effect that relies on smell, creatures within a 15 foot emanation from the leshy gain a +2 circumstance bonus to their saving throws against the effect.
