# Familiar of Restored Spirit
![[systems-pf2e-icons-actions-Passive.webp|150]]

Your familiar is pleasantly warm and soft, seeming to wash away worries with its mere presence. When you Cast or Sustain a hex, one willing creature within 15 feet of your familiar gains temporary Hit Points equal to 2 + half your level, which last until the start of your next turn.
