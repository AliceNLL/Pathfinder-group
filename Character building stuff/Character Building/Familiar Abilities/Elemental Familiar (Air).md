# Elemental Familiar (Air)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-action.svg|150]]

Your familiar gains the air elemental trait.

If your familiar stays completely still for 1 round, it becomes [[Invisible]] until it next takes an action. Any motion, even being moved or carried by another creature, ends this effect.
