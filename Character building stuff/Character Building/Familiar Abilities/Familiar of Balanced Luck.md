# Familiar of Balanced Luck
![[systems-pf2e-icons-actions-Passive.webp|150]]

Your familiar has a spot on its body that looks like a good luck charm or a bad omen, depending on the angle. When you Cast or Sustain a hex, one creature within 15 feet of your familiar gets your choice of either a +1 status bonus to its AC or a â€“1 status penalty to its AC until the start of your next turn.
