# Elemental
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-action.svg|150]]

Your familiar has the elemental trait instead of the animal trait. Choose air, earth, fire, metal, water, or wood. Your familiar gains that trait. The familiar is immune to bleed, [[Paralyzed]], poison, sleep, and the element matching its trait. Your familiar must have the resistance familiar ability to select this, unless it's a specific familiar. You can't select this ability if your familiar has a trait other than animal (such as a leshy familiar or an undead familiar).
