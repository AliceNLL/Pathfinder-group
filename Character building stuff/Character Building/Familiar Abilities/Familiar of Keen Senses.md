# Familiar of Keen Senses
![[systems-pf2e-icons-actions-Passive.webp|150]]

Your familiar has glinting eyes, twitching ears, or some other sign of a beast's powerful senses. When you Cast or Sustain a hex, your familiar gains your choice of an imprecise scent, tremorsense, or wavesense, with a range of 60 feet until the start of your next turn, and it can immediately [[Point Out]] as a free action.
