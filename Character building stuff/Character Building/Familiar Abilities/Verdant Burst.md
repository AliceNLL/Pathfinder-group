# Verdant Burst
![[systems-pf2e-icons-actions-Passive.webp|150]]

Prerequisites [[Leshy Familiar Secrets]]

When your familiar dies, it releases its primal energy to cast the 3-action version of [[Heal]], heightened to a rank 1 lower than your highest-rank spell slot. The heal spell gains a status bonus equal to twice the spell's rank to the Hit Points it restores to plants. You must be able to cast 2nd-rank spells using spell slots to select this familiar ability.
