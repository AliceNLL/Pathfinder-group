# Plant Form
![[systems-pf2e-icons-actions-Passive.webp|150]]

Your plant familiar can change shape as a single action, transforming into a Tiny plant of a type roughly similar to the familiar's nature. This otherwise uses the effects of [[One with Plants]]. You must have a familiar with the plant trait to select this ability.
