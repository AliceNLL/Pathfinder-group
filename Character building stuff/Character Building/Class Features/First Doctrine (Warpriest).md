You're trained in light and medium armor, and you have expert proficiency in Fortitude saves. You gain the [[Shield Block]] general feat, a reaction to reduce damage with a shield. If your deity's favored weapon is a simple weapon or an unarmed attack, you gain the [[Deadly Simplicity]] cleric feat. At 13th level, if you gain the [[Divine Defense]] class feature, you also gain expert proficiency in light and medium armor.
