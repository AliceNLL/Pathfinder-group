# Weapon Tricks
![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-classes-weapon-tricks.webp|150]]

You gain expert proficiency in simple weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks. When you critically succeed at an attack roll against an [[Off-Guard]] creature while using an agile or finesse weapon or an agile or finesse unarmed attack, you apply the critical specialization effect for that weapon or unarmed attack.
