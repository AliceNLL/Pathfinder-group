# Eidolon Weapon Specialization
![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-classes-eidolon-weapon-specialization.webp|150]]

Your eidolon has learned how to inflict greater injuries with its unarmed attacks. It deals 2 additional damage with unarmed attacks in which it's an expert. This damage increases to 3 if it's a master, and 4 if it's legendary.
