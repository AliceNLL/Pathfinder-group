# Catharsis Emotion (Anger)
![[icons-magic-fire-flame-burning-eye.webp|150]]

Your destructive wrath allows you to harm your foes but causes you pain in the process.

**Catharsis Trigger** An enemy deals damage to you. You can't use this reaction if you're [[Fatigued]].

**Catharsis Activation** If you're [[Grabbed]], [[Immobilized]], or [[Restrained]], you can attempt to [[Escape]]. If you succeed, the creature or hazard imposing the condition on you (if applicable) takes force damage equal to your level.

**Emotional Fervor** When you Cast a Spell from your spell slots, if the spell deals damage and doesn't have a duration, you gain a status bonus to that spell's damage equal to the spell's level. Spell: _[[Draw Ire]]_

**Emotional Fallout** You become fatigued until you Settle your Emotions.

**Focus Spell** _[[Athletic Rush]]_
