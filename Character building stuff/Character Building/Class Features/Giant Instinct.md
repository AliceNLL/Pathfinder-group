# Giant Instinct
![[icons-creatures-magical-humanoid-horned-rider.webp|150]]

Your rage gives you the raw power and size of a giant. This doesn't necessarily mean you revere giants-you might scoff at them or even aspire to slay them! You could instead seem like a giant to other people due to your exceptional strength or larger-than-life emotions and ego.

## Anathema

Failing to face a personal challenge of strength is anathema.

## Titan Mauler (Instinct Ability)

You can use a weapon built for a Large creature if you are Small or Medium (both normally and when raging). If you're not Small or Medium, you can use a weapon built for a creature one size larger than you. You gain access to this larger weapon, of any weapon type otherwise available at character creation. It has the normal Price and Bulk for a weapon of its size. When wielding such a weapon in combat, increase your additional damage from Rage from 2 to 6, but you have the [[Clumsy 1]] condition because of the weapon's unwieldy size. You can't remove this clumsy condition or ignore its penalties by any means while wielding the weapon.

## Specialization AbilityLevel 7

Increase the damage from Rage when using a larger weapon from 6 to 10; if you have greater weapon specialization, increase it from 10 to 18.

## Raging ResistanceLevel 9

You resist bludgeoning damage and your choice of cold, electricity, or fire, chosen when you gain raging resistance.

_Note: You need to manually apply Clumsy 1 when you enter rage. Remember to alter the size of your weapon to ensure your Instinct Ability works correctly._
