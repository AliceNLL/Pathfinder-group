# Battledancer
![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-classes-battledancer-style.webp|150]]

To you, a fight is a kind of performance art, and you command your foes' attention with mesmerizing motions.

You are trained in Performance and gain the [[Fascinating Performance]] skill feat. You gain [[Panache]] during an encounter when the result of your Performance check to [[Perform]] exceeds the Will DC of an observing foe, even if the foe isn't fascinated.
