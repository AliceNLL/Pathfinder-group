# Miraculous Spell
![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-classes-miraculous-spell.webp|150]]

You're exalted by your deity and gain truly incredible spells. You gain a single 10th-rank spell slot and can prepare a spell in that slot using cleric spellcasting. Unlike with other spell slots, you can't use 10-rank slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots. You don't gain more 10th-rank spells as you level up, but you can take the [[Maker of Miracles]] feat to gain a second slot.
