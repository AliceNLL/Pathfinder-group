You gain the holy trait and add that trait to any Strikes you make. In addition to your other edicts and anathema, you gain the following:

**Edicts** do not knowingly harm innocents or fail to prevent harm to an innocent if your direct intervention could save them

**Anathema** commit murder, engage in torture
