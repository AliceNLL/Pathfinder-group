# Bloodline: Undead
![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-classes-undead.webp|150]]

The touch of undeath runs through your blood. Your family tree might contain powerful undead, like a vampire, or perhaps you died and returned a bit different.

**Spell List** divine

**Bloodline Skills** Intimidation, Religion

**Granted Spells** cantrip _[[Void Warp]]_, 1st: _[[Harm]]_, 2nd: _[[False Vitality]]_, 3rd: _[[Bind Undead]]_, 4th: _[[Talking Corpse]]_, 5th: _[[Toxic Cloud]]_, 6th: _[[Vampiric Exsanguination]]_, 7th: _[[Execute]]_, 8th: _[[Desiccate]]_, 9th: _[[Wails of the Damned]]_

**Bloodline Spells** initial: _[[Undeath's Blessing]]_, advanced: _[[Drain Life]]_, greater: _[[Grasping Grave]]_

**Blood Magic** Necromantic energy flows through you or one target. Either you gain temporary Hit Points equal to the spell's level for 1 round, or a target takes 1 void damage per spell level (if the spell already deals initial void damage, combine this with the spell's initial damage before determining weaknesses and resistances).
