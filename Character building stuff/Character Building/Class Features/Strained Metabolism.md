# Strained Metabolism
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-putrefy-food-and-drink.webp|150]]

Your body's overclocked physiology requires larger-than-usual amounts of nourishment, leaving you weakened when it kicks in mid-combat.

**Mild Backlash** Your metabolism immediately burns through your body's energy stores, making you [[Enfeebled 1]] and [[Clumsy 1]] until you take a bite of food (which usually requires 2 Interact actions: one to retrieve the food and another to consume it).

**Moderate Backlash** Ravenous hunger wracks your body. You are enfeebled 1, clumsy 1, and [[Fatigued]] until you can eat a full meal, which requires at least 10 minutes.

**Severe Backlash** The strain on your body is truly incapacitating. You become [[Sickened 1|Sickened 2]] as nausea wracks you, and you are also enfeebled 1 and clumsy 1 until you can eat a full meal (which requires you to no longer be sickened). You are fatigued until you can get a full night's rest.
