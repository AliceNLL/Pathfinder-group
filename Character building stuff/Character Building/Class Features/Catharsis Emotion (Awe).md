# Catharsis Emotion (Awe)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-ectoplasmic-expulsion.webp|150]]

Your powerful sense of wonderment can be infectious and distracting.

**Catharsis Trigger** You or an ally within 30 feet critically succeeds on an attack roll against an enemy's AC or a skill check against one of an enemy's DCs.

**Catharsis Activation** If you're [[Fascinated]] or stupefied, you can attempt an additional save to end the effect if it allowed a save.

**Emotional Fervor** When you cast a spell, choose one creature that was hit by your spell attack roll or that failed its saving throw, if any. That creature becomes fascinated with you until the end of its next turn. It's then temporarily immune to this fervor effect for 1 hour. Spell: _[[Revealing Light]]_

**Emotional Fallout** You become [[Off-Guard]] until you Settle your Emotions.

**Focus Spell** _[[Dazzling Flash]]_ (doesn't require a religious symbol)
