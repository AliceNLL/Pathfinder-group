# Steed Ally
![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-classes-steed-ally.webp|150]]

You gain a young animal companion as a mount. Ordinarily, your animal companion is one that has the mount special ability, such as a horse. You can select a different animal companion (GM's discretion), but this ability doesn't grant it the mount special ability.
