# Improved Evasion
![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-classes-improved-evasion.webp|150]]

Your ability to elude danger is matchless. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to legendary. When you roll a critical failure on a Reflex save, you get a failure instead. When you roll a failure on a Reflex save against a damaging effect, you take half damage.
