# Continuous Flair
![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-classes-continuous-flair.webp|150]]

While not equal to the heights of your panache in combat, you have a dramatic flair about you in any situation.

Whenever you succeed at a check during exploration that would have granted you panache in combat, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to further checks for actions that would grant you panache in combat. This benefit ends when the exploration changes to a different scene (as determined by the GM) or shifts to an encounter or downtime.
