# Silence in Snow
![[icons-magic-water-bubbles-air-water-light.webp|150]]

Bitter cold heralded your patron's appearance, in the depths of the winter solstice or on a frozen peak at the end of the world. Your patron might be a winter hag, ice yai, or other spirit of the cold, but one thing is clear as iceâ€”their power is not to be underestimated.

**Spell List** primal

**Patron Skill** Nature

**Lesson of Winter's Chill** Your patron taught you the power of winter firsthand by subjecting you to frost and snow. You learn the [[Clinging Ice]] hex cantrip and your familiar learns [[Gust of Wind]].

**Familiar of Freezing Rime** Your familiar is cold to the touch, its breath always visible. When you Cast or Sustain a hex, you can cause ice to form in a 5 foot burst centered on a square of your familiar's space. Those squares are difficult terrain until the start of your next turn.
