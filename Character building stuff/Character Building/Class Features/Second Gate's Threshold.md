# Second Gate's Threshold
![[icons-magic-symbols-elements-air-earth-fire-water.webp|150]]

You reach a new milestone in your odyssey to become in tune with your kinetic gate and must decide how to expand the gate's power. At 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter, you choose to either expand the portal or fork the path.

*   **Expand the Portal**: Your gate attunes more precisely to one of your elements. Gain an impulse feat of your level or lower for one of your kinetic elements; if you have more than one element, you can choose a composite impulse. You also gain a gate junction for one of your kinetic elements. If you have no valid options for the feat-typically because you have one kinetic element and devoted your class feats to gaining that element's impulses-you can instead select any kineticist class feat of your level or lower for which you meet the prerequisites.
*   **Fork the Path**: Your gate reaches to another elemental plane. Add a new element of your choice to your kinetic elements. Gain an impulse feat of your level or lower with the trait of that element. You can't select a composite impulse feat with this feat selection.
