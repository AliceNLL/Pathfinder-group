# Weapon Specialization
![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-classes-weapon-specialization.webp|150]]

You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal an additional 2 damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.
