# Way of the Pistolero
![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-classes-way-of-the-pistolero.webp|150]]

Whether you're a professional duelist or a pistol-twirling entertainer, you have quick feet and quicker hands that never seem to let you down, and an equally sharp wit and tongue that jab your foes. You might leave a hand free or cultivate the ambidexterity for twin weapons. Either way, you stay close enough to your enemies to leverage your superior reflexes while leaving enough space to safely fire.
