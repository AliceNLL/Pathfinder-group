# Mystic Strikes
![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-classes-mystic-strikes.webp|150]]

Focusing your will into your physical attacks imbues them with mystical energy. Your unarmed attacks become magical, allowing them to get past resistances to non-magical attacks. However, you still need an item such as [[Handwraps of Mighty Blows|Handwraps of Mighty Blows (+1)]] to gain an item bonus to attack rolls or increase your attacks' weapon damage dice.
