# Greater Weapon Specialization (Barbarian)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-classes-greater-weapon-specialization.webp|150]]

The weapons you've mastered become truly fearsome in your hands. Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert, 6 if you're a master, and 8 if you're legendary.

You gain a greater benefit from your instinct's specialization ability. See specific instincts for more information.
