![[icons-sundries-books-book-embossed-jewel-gold-green.webp|150]]

You have learned how to create perpetual alchemical infusions that can provide a near-infinite supply of certain simple items.

You gain the ability to create two 1st-level alchemical items using [[Quick Alchemy]] without spending a batch of infused reagents. The items you can select depend on your research field and must be in your formula book.

Each time you gain a level, you can swap any number of your perpetual infusions with other eligible infusions.

Choose two 1st-level bombs.
