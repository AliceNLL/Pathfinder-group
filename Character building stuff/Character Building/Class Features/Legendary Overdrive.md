# Legendary Overdrive
![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-classes-legendary-overdrive.webp|150]]

Your peerless inventing and Crafting ability has supercharged your Overdrives. You become legendary in Crafting, and on a successful Overdrive, you increase the additional damage by a total of 3, replacing the increase from master overdrive.
