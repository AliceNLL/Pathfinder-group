# Magnum Opus
![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-classes-magnum-opus.webp|150]]

You have tuned your spellcasting to the highest caliber. Add two common 10th-rank occult spells to your repertoire. You gain a single 10th-rank spell slot you can use to cast these spells using bard spellcasting. Unlike other spell slots, you can't use 10th-rank slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots. You don't gain more 10th-rank spells as you level up, but you can take the Perfect Encore feat to gain a second slot.
