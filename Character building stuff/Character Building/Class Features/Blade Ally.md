For a champion following the tenets of good, choose [[Vitalizing|Disrupting]], [[Ghost Touch]], [[Returning]], or [[Shifting]]. If you are a champion following the tenets of evil, you can choose the following property runes: [[Fearsome]], returning, or shifting. You also gain the weapon's critical specialization effect.
