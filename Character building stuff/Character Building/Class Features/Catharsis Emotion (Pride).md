# Catharsis Emotion (Pride)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-feeblemind.webp|150]]

All is well as long as you appear well, but you get caught up in the moment and lose track of what's important.

**Catharsis Trigger** You critically fail on an attack roll or saving throw.

**Catharsis Activation** The critical failure becomes a failure.

**Emotional Fervor** Each time you cast an illusion spell, until the start of your next turn, any critical failure you roll on an attack roll or saving throw is a failure instead. Spell: _[[Dizzying Colors]]_

**Emotional Fallout** You momentarily lose track of what's real, becoming [[Confused]] for 1 round. Spell: mirror image

**Focus Spell** _[[Veil of Confidence]]_
