# Divine Ally
![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-classes-divine-ally.webp|150]]

Your devotion attracts a spirit of your deity's alignment. Once you choose an ally, your choice can't be changed.

The following are divine allies:

**Blade Ally** A spirit of battle dwells within your armaments. Select one weapon or [[Handwraps of Mighty Blows|Handwraps of Mighty Blows (+1)]] when you make your daily preparations. In your hands, the item gains the effect of a property rune. For a champion following the tenets of good, choose _disrupting_, _ghost touch_,_returning_, or _shifting_. You also gain the weapon's critical specialization effect.

If you are a champion following the tenets of evil, you can choose the following property runes: _fearsome_, _returning_, or _shifting_.

**Shield Ally** A spirit of protection dwells within your shield. In your hands, the shield's Hardness increases by 2 and its HP and BT increase by half.

**Steed Ally** You gain a young animal companion as a mount. Ordinarily, your animal companion is one that has the mount special ability, such as a horse. You can select a different animal companion (GM's discretion), but this ability doesn't grant it the mount special ability.
