# Psychic Weapon Specialization
![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-classes-weapon-specialization.webp|150]]

As you touch a weapon, you glimpse the hands that made and wielded it, teaching you how to inflict greater injuries. You deal 2 additional Damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.
