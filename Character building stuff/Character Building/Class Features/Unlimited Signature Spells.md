# Unlimited Signature Spells
![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-classes-unlimited-signature-spells.webp|150]]

All of your spells are signature spells. That means that if you know a spell, you can heighten it freely by casting it from a higher-level spell slot, up to the maximum level of spell you can cast. You can similarly cast any of its lower-level versions without learning them separately.
