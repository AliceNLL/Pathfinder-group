![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-classes-deductive-improvisation.webp|150]]

You use your skills at deduction to perform whatever task is necessary to solve the case.

You can attempt any check that requires you to be trained in a skill, even if you're untrained in it; you can attempt any check that requires you to have expert proficiency in a skill so long as you're trained in it; and you can attempt any check that requires you to have master proficiency in a skill as long as you have expert proficiency in it.
