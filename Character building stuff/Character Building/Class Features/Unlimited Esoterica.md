# Unlimited Esoterica
![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-classes-unlimited-esoterica.webp|150]]

Your understanding of your esoterica becomes so complete that you can access your mystic tools without even thinking. You can use Exploit Vulnerability or Intensify Vulnerability as a free action, rather than a single action, though still with a frequency of only once per round.
