# Battle Hardened
![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-classes-juggerenaut.webp|150]]

Your experience in battle helps protect you against magic and toxins alike. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead.
