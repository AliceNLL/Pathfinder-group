# Energy Barrier
![[systems-pf2e-icons-default-icons-feat.svg|150]]

Your armor's defenses ablate any kind of energy coming your way. While wearing your armor, you gain resistance to all energy damage (acid, cold, electricity, fire, force, sonic, vitality, and void damage) equal to 2 + half your level. You must have the harmonic oscillator, metallic reactance, or phlogistonic regulator modification to select this modification.
