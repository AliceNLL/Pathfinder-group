# Exemplary Finisher
![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-classes-exemplary-finisher.webp|150]]

You execute your finishing moves with spectacular flair, adding special effects to your finishers. If a Strike you make as part of a finisher hits a foe, you add one of the following effects to the Strike, depending on your swashbuckler's style.

*   **Battledancer** You can Step as a free action immediately after the finisher.
*   **Braggart** If the foe was temporarily immune to your [[Demoralize]], their temporary immunity ends.
*   **Fencer** The foe is [[Off-Guard]] until your next turn.
*   **Gymnast** If the foe is [[Grabbed]], [[Restrained]], or [[Prone]], you gain a circumstance bonus to the damage roll equal to twice the number of weapon damage dice.
*   **Wit** The foe takes a -2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls against you until the start of your next turn.
