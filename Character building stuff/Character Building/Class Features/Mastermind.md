# Mastermind
![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-classes-mastermind.webp|150]]

You rely on your intellect to craft intricate schemes, planning 10 steps ahead where others might plan three. You might be a driven detective, a spymaster in the service of a powerful house, or an aspiring crime lord or information broker.

If you successfully identify a creature using [[Recall Knowledge]], that creature is [[Off-Guard]] against your attacks until the start of your next turn; if you critically succeed, it's off-guard against your attacks for 1 minute.

You're trained in Society and one of the following skills of your choice: Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion. You can choose Intelligence as your key attribute.
