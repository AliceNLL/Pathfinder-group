# Muscular Exoskeleton
![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-classes-muscular-exoskeleton.webp|150]]

Your armor supports your muscles with a carefully crafted exoskeleton. When you send your armor into overdrive, the exoskeleton supplements your feats of athletics as well. When under the effects of Overdrive, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Athletics checks; if you're a master in Crafting, this increases to a +2 circumstance bonus.
