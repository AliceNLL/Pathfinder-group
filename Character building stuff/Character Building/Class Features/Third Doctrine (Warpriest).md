# Third Doctrine (Warpriest)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-classes-warpriest.webp|150]]

You gain expert proficiency with your deity's favored weapon, martial weapons, simple weapons, and unarmed attacks. When you critically succeed at an attack roll using your deity's favored weapon, you apply the weapon's critical specialization effect; you can use your spell DC in place of your class DC.
