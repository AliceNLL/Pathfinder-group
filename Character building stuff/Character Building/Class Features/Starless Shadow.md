# Starless Shadow
![[icons-magic-perception-eye-ringed-glow-angry-small-teal.webp|150]]

Your patron first contacted you at the witching hour, as your body lay paralyzed by sleep while your mind had yet to escape the waking world. Your patron might be a creature of the Netherworld or a long-forgotten spirit of twilightâ€”all you remember of them are haunting eyes of moonlight, offering you power from the darkness.

**Spell List** occult

**Patron Skill** Occultism

**Lesson of Night's Terrors** Your patron taught you that the darkness can hide all manner of things best left unseen. You gain the [[Shroud of Night]] hex cantrip, and your familiar learns [[Fear]].

**Familiar of Stalking Night** Your familiar is dark of fur or feather, and light seems to disappear into it. When you Cast or Sustain a hex, and your familiar is adjacent to an enemy to which it's [[Concealed]], [[Hidden]], or undetected, the enemy becomes [[Frightened|Frightened 1]].
