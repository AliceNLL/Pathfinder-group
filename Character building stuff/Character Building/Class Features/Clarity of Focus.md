# Clarity of Focus
![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-classes-clarity-of-focus.webp|150]]

Your deepening connection to your mind grants you more power to fuel your psi amps. Increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1. This ability doesn't change the number of Focus Points you regain when you [[Refocus]]. As normal, this ability can't increase the size of your focus pool above 3 points.
