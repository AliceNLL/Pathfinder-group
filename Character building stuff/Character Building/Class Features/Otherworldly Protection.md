# Otherworldly Protection
![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-classes-otherworldly-protection.webp|150]]

Just because you use science doesn't mean you can't build your armor with carefully chosen materials and gizmos designed to protect against otherworldly attacks. You gain resistance equal to 3 + half your level to void damage, or to vitality damage if you have void healing (such as if you're a dhampir). You gain the same amount of resistance to any types of alignment damage—good, evil, chaotic, lawful—that can damage you (note that creatures don't take a given type of alignment damage unless they are of the opposing alignment; for instance, you can take spirit damage only if you are good in alignment).
