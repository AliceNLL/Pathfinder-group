![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-classes-wit-style.webp|150]]

You are friendly, clever, and full of humor, always knowing just what to say in any situation. Your witticisms leave foes unprepared for the skill and speed of your attacks.

You are trained in Diplomacy and gain the [[Bon Mot]] skill feat. You gain [[Panache]] during an encounter whenever you succeed at a Bon Mot against a foe.
