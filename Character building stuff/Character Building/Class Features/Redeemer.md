# Redeemer
![[icons-magic-nature-symbol-sun-yellow.webp|150]]

You're full of kindness and forgiveness. You gain the [[Glimpse of Redemption]] champion's reaction and the [[Lay on Hands]] devotion spell. Your code gains the follow edicts and anathema:

**Edicts** try to redeem those who commit wicked deeds, show compassion to others regardless of their authority or station

**Anathema** kill a sapient enemy without first offering a chance at redemption

## Divine SmiteLevel 9

A guilty conscience assails foes who spurn your Glimpse of Redemption. A foe that responds to your Glimpse of Redemption by dealing damage takes persistent spirit damage equal to your Charisma modifier.

## ExaltLevel 11

You protect multiple allies. You can apply the resistance granted by Glimpse of Redemption to yourself and all allies within 15 feet of you, including the triggering ally, except the resistance is reduced by 2 for all.
