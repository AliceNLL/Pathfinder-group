# Maestro
![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-classes-maestro.webp|150]]

Your muse constantly inspires you to greater heights of artistic prowess. For many bards, a teacher or rival fills this role, although some set their sights higher and attempt to surpass great composers of the past or blaze a new trail entirely. If your muse is a supernatural creature, it might be one who loves to perform, such as a choral angel or a lyrakien azata; if a deity, it might be Shelyn. Art inspired by a maestro muse is precise and inventive, a formalist achievement.

As a bard with a maestro muse, you are an inspiration to your allies and confident of your musical and oratorical abilities.
