# Double Spellstrike
![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-classes-double-spellstrike.webp|150]]

You can extend the magic of spells you store with Spellstrike. After you make a Spellstrike with a spell cast from a spell slot, you retain an echo of the spell, stored in your body. The next time you Spellstrike, you can cast the same spell again without expending a spell slot.

If you choose to cast a different spell with Spellstrike, or you go 1 minute without using the stored spell, the stored spell dissipates harmlessly.
