# Greater Performer's Heart

Your performances warp the mind and cause emotions to flower, and understanding how to do this also forges an incomparable understanding of your own mind. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to legendary. When you roll a critical failure on a Will save, you get a failure instead. When you fail a Will save against an effect that deals damage, you take half damage.
