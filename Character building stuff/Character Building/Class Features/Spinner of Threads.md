# Spinner of Threads
![[icons-magic-nature-tree-bare-glow-yellow.webp|150]]

You met your patron in a memory of an encounter yet to come or a premonition of something long since passed, as they untangled and re-spun the tapestry of time and fate. Was your patron a norn? A herald of a deity like Pharasma, Alseta, or Grandmother Spider? Could it even be a single individual appearing at three or more points in its timeline—multiple versions of the same being, parallel threads converging on a single moment?

**Spell List** occult

**Patron Skill** Occultism

**Lesson of Fate's Vicissitudes** Your patron's harsh lesson is that fate spares no one, rising and falling in turn for all. You gain the [[Nudge Fate]] hex cantrip and your familiar learns [[Sure Strike]].

**Familiar of Balanced Luck** Your familiar has a spot on its body that looks like a good luck charm or a bad omen, depending on the angle. When you Cast or Sustain a hex, one creature within 15 feet of your familiar gets your choice of either a +1 status bonus to its AC or a –1 status penalty to its AC until the start of your next turn.
