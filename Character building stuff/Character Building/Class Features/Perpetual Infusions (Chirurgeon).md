# Perpetual Infusions (Chirurgeon)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-classes-perpetual-infusions-chirurgeon.webp|150]]

You have learned how to create perpetual alchemical infusions that can provide a near-infinite supply of certain simple items.

You gain the ability to create two 1st-level alchemical items using [[Quick Alchemy]] without spending a batch of infused reagents. The items you can select depend on your research field and must be in your formula book.

Each time you gain a level, you can swap any number of your perpetual infusions with other eligible infusions.

* * *

Choose two 1st-level elixirs with the healing trait. If a creature heals Hit Points from a perpetual infusion, that creature is temporarily immune to healing Hit Points from subsequent perpetual infusions for 10 minutes (but not immune to any other effects of those infusions).
