# Catharsis Emotion (Dedication)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-phantom-crowd.webp|150]]

Your commitment protects those you are dedicated to but can lead to dependency. Your emotional focus is an individual creature you're bound to.

**Catharsis Trigger** Your emotional focus takes damage from an enemy while within 30 feet of you.

**Catharsis Activation** Your emotional focus gains a number of temporary Hit Points equal to half your level rounded up. These temporary HP last for 1 minute.

**Emotional Fervor** Your spells that target your emotional focus gain the benefits of Reach Spell. When you cast a healing spell that affects your emotional focus, your emotional focus also gains temporary HP equal to the spell's level in addition to the spell's effects. These temporary HP last for 1 minute. Spell: _[[Spirit Link]]_

**Emotional Fallout** Until you Settle your Emotions, you can't Cast Spells unless you're adjacent to your emotional focus.

**Focus Spell** _[[Protector's Sacrifice]]_
