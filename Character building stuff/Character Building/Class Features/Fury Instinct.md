![[icons-magic-unholy-silhouette-evil-horned-giant.webp|150]]

Your rage comes from a deep and purely personal well within you. You use your rage as you choose.

## Anathema and Instinct Ability

You don't have an anathema or an instinct ability. Instead, you gain an additional 1st-level barbarian feat.

## Specialization AbilityLevel 7

Increase the additional damage from Rage from 2 to 6. If you have greater weapon specialization, instead increase the additional damage from Rage to 12.

## Raging ResistanceLevel 9

You resist physical weapon damage, but not physical damage from other sources (such as unarmed attacks).
