# Kinetic Durability
![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-classes-magical-fortitude.webp|150]]

The sustenance of your inner gate counters harm that would come to your body. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead.
