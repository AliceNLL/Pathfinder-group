# Flexible Spell Preparation
![[icons-magic-unholy-hand-marked-pink.webp|150]]

This class feature alters your spellcasting class feature (such as Arcane Spellcasting for the wizard or Divine Spellcasting for the cleric). If you choose this class archetype, you must select [[Flexible Spellcaster Dedication]] as your 2nd-level class feat.

**Prerequisites** You must have a class, such as clerics, druids, witches, and wizards, that prepares spells in spell slots using the same number of prepared spells per day.

**Flexible Spellcaster Adjustments** You learn spells as normal for your class (a wizard uses a spellbook, a witch teaches spells to their familiar, and so on), but change your spellcasting from your class as follows.

*   You can cast fewer spells each day. Your number of spell slots per day don't advance from 2 to 3 spells at even levels.
*   Reduce the number of cantrips you gain from your class by 2. This archetype doesn't change the way you prepare cantrips.
*   During your daily preparations, you prepare a spell collection rather than preparing spells into each spell slot individually. The number of spells in your spell collection each day equals the total number of spell slots you get each day from your class spells. Select these spells from the same source as normal, such as from a spellbook for a wizard.
*   You can cast any of the spells in your collection by using a spell slot of an appropriate level. For instance, if you were level 1 and had _[[Gentle Landing]]_ and _[[Force Barrage]]_ in your spell collection, you could cast _feather fall_ twice that day, _magic missile_ twice, or each spell once.
*   Extra spell slots you gain that have additional restrictions, like the wizard's specialist school spells or the cleric's divine font spells, don't change due to this archetype, nor do such spells count toward the number of spells you place in your spell collection.

### RESTRICTED SPELL SLOTS

When applying this archetype to a class that grants additional spell slots with restrictions, such as the specialist wizard's specialist school spells or the cleric's divine bond, you still gain those additional slots, but they work as normal for your class, and they don't add more spells to your spell collection. A healing font grants you additional spell slots to cast _[[Heal]]_ spells of the highest level you can cast, but doesn't add _heal_ to your spell collection. A harming font does the same for the _[[Harm]]_ spell. As a specialist wizard, you prepare one spell per level from your specialty school, which also aren't added to your spell collection.

### HEIGHTENING SPELLS

Once you gain 2nd-level spells, you can heighten any spell in your spell collection to any level you can cast,similar to a spontaneous spellcaster's signature spells. The only restriction is that you must select at least one 1st-level spell for your collection each time you prepare, ensuring that you can use all your spell slots each day.

### ADJUDICATING CLASS FEATS AND FEATURES

Some of your class feats or features might rely on the fact that you prepare spells in spell slots. While some class feats might no longer work or be necessary with the flexible spellcaster archetype, in many cases you can make a simple replacement and continue using the class feat. The following class feats simply require replacing "a spell you have prepared" or "a prepared spell" for "a spell in your collection" or "a spell slot." For example, in [[Counterspell (Prepared)|Counterspell]], you'd replace "a spell you have prepared" in the trigger for "a spell in your collection" and "expend a prepared spell" for "expend a spell slot." Similarly, in [[Arcane Bond]], you'd replace "cast one spell you prepared today and already cast" with "cast one spell in your collection you've already cast today."

The Counterspell and [[Ley Line Conduit|Leyline Conduit]] feats in the Core Rulebook need these substitutions, as does [[Form Retention]] from the Advanced Player's Guide. [[Spell Mastery]] provides additional restricted spells, like divine font or specialist spells; you can take it, but it doesn't add to your collection and works like normal prepared spells.

### DISALLOWED FEATS

The following feats from the Core Rulebook aren't available for a flexible spellcaster: [[Call of the Wild]], [[Clever Counterspell]], [[Infinite Possibilities]], [[Reprepare Spell]], and [[Spell Combination]]. The disallowed feats from the Advanced Player's Guide are as follows: [[Elemental Summons]], [[Miraculous Possibility]], [[Rites Of Convocation]], and [[Rites Of Transfiguration]].

| \* Your class most likely has a class feature that gives you a single 10th level spell that works a bit differently from other slots. If so, flexible spellcaster doesn't change the way that spell works. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
