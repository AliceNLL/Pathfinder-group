![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-classes-fencer-style.webp|150]]

You move carefully, feinting and creating false openings to lead your foes into inopportune attacks.

You are trained in Deception. You gain [[Panache]] during an encounter whenever you successfully [[Feint]] or [[Create a Diversion]] against a foe.
