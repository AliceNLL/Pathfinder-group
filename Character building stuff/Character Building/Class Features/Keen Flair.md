# Keen Flair
![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-classes-keen-flair.webp|150]]

You inflict particularly devastating attacks on even well-defended foes. When you Strike with a weapon or unarmed attack with which you have master proficiency, if you roll a 19 on the die and the roll is a success, you critically succeed instead.
