# Interrogation Methodology
![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-classes-interrogation-methodology.webp|150]]

People can't help but trust you, whether through your inherent likableness or your firm insistence on sticking to the truth. You have a way about you that gets others talking, and you've developed interrogative techniques to help you get to the truth of your investigations.

You are trained in Diplomacy. You gain the [[No Cause For Alarm]] skill feat. You can also [[Pursue a Lead]] over the course of a conversation rather than spending dedicated time looking into the lead, provided the conversation lasts 1 minute or longer. For example, while trying to [[Make an Impression]], you could pursue the creature you're conversing with as a lead, and you could Pursue a Lead about an object while someone is telling you information about that object. You also gain the [[Pointed Question]] action.
