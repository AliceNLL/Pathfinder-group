# Reflow Elements
![[icons-magic-fire-explosion-flame-blue.webp|150]]

You twist one of the impulses you've learned into a different but still similar magic. When you make your daily preparations, you can replace one of your impulse feats with a different impulse feat that has the same elemental trait. You can reflow only impulse feats that have exactly one elemental trait, not composite impulse feats or feats that vary by element. This follows the same rules as retraining; you can replace impulse feats gained through your class feats or through class features that grant you impulse feats.
