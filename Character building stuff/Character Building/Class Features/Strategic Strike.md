# Strategic Strike
![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-classes-strategic-strike.webp|150]]

When you strike carefully and with forethought, you deal a telling blow. When making a Strike that adds your Intelligence modifier on your attack roll due to [[Devise a Stratagem|Devising a Stratagem]], you deal an additional 1d6 precision damage.

As your investigator level increases, so too does the deadliness of your strategic strike. Increase the number of dice by one at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels.
