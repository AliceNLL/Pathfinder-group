# Integrated Gauntlet
![[icons-weapons-fist-fist-katar-triple-gold-black.webp|150]]

**One-Handed Weapon Only; Can't Have the Two-Hand Trait**

* * *

Combining your weapon with a gauntlet, you make it so you can quickly switch between attacking with your weapon and tinkering using your hands. Your innovation gains the free-hand trait.
