# Druidic Order
![[icons-magic-symbols-question-stone-yellow.webp|150]]

Upon becoming a druid, you align yourself with a druidic order, which grants you a class feat, an order spell (see below), and an additional trained skill tied to your order While you'll always be a member of your initial order, it's not unheard of for a druid to request to study with other orders in search of greater understanding of the natural world, and PC druids are among the most likely to blend the powers of different orders.

Order spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to commune with local nature spirits or otherwise tend to the wilderness in a way befitting your order.

Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Certain feats give you more focus spells. The maximum Focus Points your focus pool can hold is equal to the number of focus spells you have, but can never be more than 3 points.

**Order Skill** You become trained in the listed skill. If you're already trained in that skill, you become trained in a different skill of your choice.

**Druid Feat** You gain this 1st-level druid feat as a bonus feat.

**Order Spell** You automatically gain the listed order spell at 1st level.

**Anathema** Add this anathema to those for all druids.
