# Anathema (Druid)
![[icons-consumables-plants-leaf-hastate-glowing-green.webp|150]]

As stewards of the natural order, druids find affronts to nature anathema. If you repeatedly perform these acts, you lose your magical abilities from the druid class, including your druid spellcasting and the benefits of your order. These abilities can be regained only if you demonstrate your repentance with an [[Atone]] ritual. The following acts are anathema to all druids.

**Anathema** despoil natural places, consume more natural resources than you require to live comfortably, teach the Wildsong to non-druids.

Your choice of druidic order adds further anathema, as detailed in the order's entry.
