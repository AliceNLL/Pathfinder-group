# Infinite Mind
![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-classes-infinite-mind.webp|150]]

Anything you can imagine is now within the realm of possibility. Add two common 10th-level occult spells to your repertoire; you gain a single 10th-level spell slot you can use to cast one of those two spells using psychic spellcasting. You don't gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, unlike other spell slots, and you can't use 10th-level slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots. You can take the [[Mind Over Matter]] psychic feat to gain a second slot.
