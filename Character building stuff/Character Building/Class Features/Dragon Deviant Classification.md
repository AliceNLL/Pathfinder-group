# Dragon Deviant Classification
![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-dragon-breath.webp|150]]

Deviant abilities often trace their origin to massive concentrations of energy, such as being at ground zero of a detonating magical artifact. These energies can linger within an individual to grant them deviations falling under the dragon classification—gouts of flame, electrical breath, and the like—projecting and absorbing it to great effect.

When you gain a dragon-type deviation, choose a type of damage, from cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. All abilities you gain from this deviation deal this type of damage and add the corresponding trait to the ability. You also use this damage type for the damage and weakness from your backlash.

## Backlash

[[Energetic Meltdown]]

The same blood that lets one of the dragon-descended spit out a gout of flame is precisely what keeps the inside of their mouth from being singed in the furnace. Deviations, unfortunately, lack these safeguards, their powers coming from haphazard circumstance and interactions rather than intentional design. A character using their deviation always risks the chance of backlash.

Whenever you attempt to use a deviation, roll a DC 5 flat); on a failure, you use your deviation and then suffer a backlash effect, after which your flat check DC resets to 5. Backlash progresses from mild, to moderate, to severe. When you have already taken mild backlash in a given day, the next time you would take backlash, you take the moderate backlash instead, and if you have already taken moderate backlash, you take the severe backlash instead, and your deviation can't be used for the rest of the day—attempting to use it simply brings pain. When you make your daily preparations, your flat check DC returns to 5 and your next backlash returns to mild.

Any effects from backlash can't be reduced, prevented, or otherwise bypassed. Conditions and damage you take from backlash can't be reduced or prevented by resistance or immunity, but still triggers any weakness you have to it.
