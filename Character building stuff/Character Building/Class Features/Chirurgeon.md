# Chirurgeon
![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-classes-chirurgeon.webp|150]]

You concentrate on healing others with alchemy. You start with the formulas for two common 1st-level alchemical elixirs with the healing trait, in addition to your other formulas.

Your research field adds a number of formulas to your formula book; these are your signature items. When using a batch of [[Infused Reagents]] to create your signature items using [[Advanced Alchemy]], you create three items instead of two. Each time you gain a level, you can swap one of your signature items with another formula in your formula book. This new signature item must be on your research field's list of possible signature items.

You can use your proficiency rank in Crafting for anything that requires a proficiency rank in Medicine (such as prerequisites), and use your Crafting modifier in place of your Medicine modifier for all Medicine checks.
