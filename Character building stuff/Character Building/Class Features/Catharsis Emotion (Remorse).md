![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-illusory-disguise.webp|150]]

You attempt to overcome your failings, but your guilt stays with you.

**Catharsis Trigger** An ally within 30 feet drops to 0 Hit Points.

**Catharsis Activation** You Step or Stride. You must end this movement closer to the triggering ally.

**Emotional Fervor** Any spell you cast that restores Hit Points to the triggering ally gets a status bonus to the Hit Points healed equal to the spell's level, or double the spell's level if the ally is at 0 Hit Points. Spell: _[[Warrior's Regret]]_

**Emotional Fallout** Your emotional weight crushes you, leaving you [[Stupefied|Stupefied 2]] until you Settle your Emotions.

**Focus Spell** _[[Healer's Blessing]]_
