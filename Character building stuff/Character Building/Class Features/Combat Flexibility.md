# Combat Flexibility
![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-classes-combat-flexibility.webp|150]]

You can prepare your tactics to suit different situations. When you make your daily preparations, you gain one fighter feat of 8th level or lower that you meet the prerequisites for and don't already have. You can use that feat until your next daily preparations.
