# Raging Resistance
![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-classes-raging-resistance.webp|150]]

Repeated exposure and toughened skin allow you to fend off harm. While raging, you gain resistance equal to 3 + your Constitution modifier to damage types based on your instinct.

See specific instincts for more information.
