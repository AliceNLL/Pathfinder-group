# Greater Field Discovery (Toxicologist)
![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-classes-greater-field-discovery-chirurgeon.webp|150]]

You learn an incredible discovery that advances your understanding of your field.

You can apply two different injury poisons to the same weapon, though not to a piece of ammunition. The two poisons can be up to six levels lower than your level, and you can't use the poisons made without spending a batch of infused reagents via [[Perpetual Infusions (Toxicologist)|Perpetual Infusions]]. Applying the two poisons requires a separate action to apply each poison.

Once completed, you combine the two poisons on the weapon into a double poison with the lower of the two poisons' DCs. This double poison is only virulent if both poisons were virulent, and if the poisons have a different number of stages, the double poison has a number of stages equal to the poison with the lower number of stages. The target takes the effects of both poisons for its current stage.
