![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-bestial-curse.webp|150]]

**Catharsis Trigger** You start your first turn in an encounter against your emotional focus or one of their followers. If the encounter includes multiple eligible followers and doesn't include your actual emotional focus, choose one of the followers to act as your emotional focus for this encounter (or until your actual emotional focus shows up).

**Catharsis Activation** You can Step or Stride. You must end this movement closer to your emotional focus.

**Emotional Fervor** Your emotional focus is [[Off-Guard]] to you and takes a –2 status penalty to saves against your spells. You're off-guard to your emotional focus and take a –2 status penalty to saves against it. Spell: _[[Blood Vendetta]]_

**Emotional Fallout** You become [[Stunned 1|Stunned 2]].

**Focus Spell** _[[Cry of Destruction]]_
