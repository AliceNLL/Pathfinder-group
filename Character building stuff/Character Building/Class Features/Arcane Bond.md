# Arcane Bond
![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-classes-arcane-bond.webp|150]]

You place some of your magical power in a bonded item. Each day when you prepare your spells, you can designate a single item you own as your bonded item. This is typically an item associated with spellcasting, such as a wand, ring, or staff, but you are free to designate a weapon or other item. You gain the [[Drain Bonded Item]] free action.
