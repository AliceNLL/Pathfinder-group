# Dynamic Weighting
![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-classes-dynamic-weighting.webp|150]]

Your weapon's modified weight distribution can increase power in exchange for taking more hands to wield. Your innovation gains the two-hand trait, with a damage die one size higher than the weapon's normal weapon damage die size (for instance, a longsword would gain the two-hand d10 trait). Your innovation also gains the versatile B trait.
