# Patron Theme
![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-classes-patreon-theme.webp|150]]

Each patron has a theme, regardless of their nature or identity. This theme describes the forces over which the patron grants a witch influence. Some patrons are multifaceted, granting different themes and teaching different lessons to different witches. Your patron's theme determines the following.

*   **Spell List** You use this magical tradition and spell list.
*   **Patron Skill** You become trained in the listed skill.
*   **Hex Cantrip** You gain this special hex cantrip.
*   **Granted Spell** Your familiar automatically learns the spell listed here, in addition to those you gain through witch spellcasting.
