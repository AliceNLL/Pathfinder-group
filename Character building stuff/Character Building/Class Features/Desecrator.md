You always take what pleases you, no matter who it hurts, and you spread the influence of evil across all you touch. You gain the [[Selfish Shield]] champion's reaction and the [[Touch of Corruption]] devotion spell. You gain the follow edicts and anathema:

**Edicts** subvert or corrupt everything in your path that is pure or holy, sow doubt among those holding ideals of purity or holiness

**Anathema** none

## Divine SmiteLevel 9

If your Charisma modifier is +2 or greater, your resistance against the triggering damage equals your Charisma modifier + half your level

## ExaltLevel 11

When you use Selfish Shield, each enemy within 15 feet of you takes a -1 status penalty to attack rolls against you until the start of your next turn.
