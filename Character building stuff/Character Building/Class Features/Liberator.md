![[icons-creatures-birds-songbird-yellow-flying.webp|150]]

You defend the freedom of others. You gain the [[Liberating Step]] champion's reaction and the [[Lay on Hands]] devotion spell. Your code gains the follow edicts and anathema:

**Edicts** try to redeem those who commit wicked deeds, show compassion to others regardless of their authority or station

**Anathema** kill a sapient enemy without first offering a chance at redemption

## Divine SmiteLevel 9

You punish those who ensnare your allies in bondage. If the triggering enemy was using any effects to make your ally grabbed, restrained, immobilized, or paralyzed when you used Liberating Step, that enemy takes persistent spirit damage equal to your Charisma modifier.

## ExaltLevel 11

You can help your whole group get into position. When you use Liberating Step, if your ally doesn't attempt to break free of an effect, you and all allies within 15 feet can Step, in addition to the triggering ally.
