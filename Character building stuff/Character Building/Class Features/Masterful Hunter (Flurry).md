## Masterful Hunter UpgradeLevel 17

You can blend your weapon mastery with skillful targeting to make a series of precise attacks.

If you have master proficiency with your weapon, your multiple attack penalty for attacks against your hunted prey is -2 (-1 with an agile weapon) on your second attack of the turn, and -4 (-2 with an agile weapon) on your third and subsequent attacks of the turn.
