![[systems-pf2e-icons-spells-captivating-adoration.webp|150]]

Your unbridled enthusiasm and positive attitude can lead you to success, but you might expend more energy than you planned.

**Catharsis Trigger** You critically succeed on an attack roll or save, or an enemy critically fails on a save against you.

**Catharsis Activation** Reduce the value of any [[Frightened]] or [[Stupefied]] condition you have by 1 and end any persistent mental damage you have.

**Emotional Fervor** You gain a +1 status bonus to Performance checks and to the spell attack rolls of emotion spells, and enemies take a â€“1 status penalty to saves against your emotion spells. Spell: _[[Laughing Fit]]_

**Emotional Fallout** You become [[Fatigued]] until you Settle your Emotions.

**Focus Spell** _[[Unimpeded Stride]]_
