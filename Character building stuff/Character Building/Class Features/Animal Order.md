# Animal Order
![[icons-creatures-abilities-bear-roar-bite-brown-green.webp|150]]

You have a strong connection to beasts, always feeling like you understood them (and they you) better than your own people. You stand for the animals of nature, a powerful animal companion at your side.

**Order Skill** Athletics

**Druid Feat** [[Animal Companion]]

**Order Spell** [[Heal Animal]]

**Anathema** Commit wanton cruelty to animals or kill animals unnecessarily. (This doesn't prevent you from defending yourself against animals or killing them cleanly for food).
