# Flurry of Blows
![[systems-pf2e-icons-features-classes-flurry-of-blows.webp|150]]

You can attack rapidly with fists, feet, elbows, knees, and other unarmed attacks. You gain the Flurry of Blows action.

* * *

Make two unarmed [[Strike|Strikes]]. If both hit the same creature, combine their damage for the purpose of resistances and weaknesses. Apply your multiple attack penalty to the Strikes normally. As it has the flourish trait, you can use Flurry of Blows only once per turn.
