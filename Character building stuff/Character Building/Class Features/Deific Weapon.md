# Deific Weapon
![[icons-skills-melee-weapons-crossed-swords-purple.webp|150]]

You zealously bear your deity's favored weapon. If it's uncommon, you gain access to it. If it's an unarmed attack with a d4 damage die or a simple weapon, increase the damage die by one step (d4 to d6, d6 to d8, d8 to d10, d10 to d12).
