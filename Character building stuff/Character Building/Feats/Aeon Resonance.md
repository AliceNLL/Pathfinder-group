# Aeon Resonance
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You gain the resonant power of one embedded _aeon stone_ as if it were placed in a wayfinder. While you can embed multiple _aeon stones_ in your flesh, you can gain the resonance power from only one embedded stone at a time, selected each day when you make your daily preparations.

* * *

**Special** At 8th level, you can take this feat again. If you do, you gain the resonance powers of up to four invested _aeon stones_ instead of only one.
