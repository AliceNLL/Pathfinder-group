# Incredible Scout
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

When you scout, you are particularly alert for danger, granting your allies precious moments to prepare to fight.

When using the [[Scout]] exploration activity, you grant your allies a +2 circumstance bonus to their initiative rolls instead of a +1 circumstance bonus.
