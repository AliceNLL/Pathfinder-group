# Overwhelming Blow
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You throw your weight into a powerful attack that leaves you vulnerable. Make a melee Strike. This counts as three attacks when calculating your multiple attack penalty. If this Strike hits, you get a critical hit. If you roll a critical hit, your weapon or unarmed attack also gains the deadly d12 trait (this replaces any deadly trait it already has). Whether or not you hit, you become [[Stunned 1]] and are [[Off-Guard]] until the start of your next turn.
