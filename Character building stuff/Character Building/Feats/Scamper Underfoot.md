# Scamper Underfoot
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You are used to ducking under foes and can scurry around the battlefield with ease. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Acrobatics checks to [[Tumble Through]] the spaces of Medium or larger enemies, and the presence of an enemy doesn't make the squares difficult terrain.
