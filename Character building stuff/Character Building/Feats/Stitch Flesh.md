# Stitch Flesh
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You can use [[Treat Wounds]] to restore Hit Points to undead creatures, not just living ones. The techniques you use to do so vary, but all require sutures, bandages, and other tools included in healer's tools. Some conditions that might raise the DC of treating undead's wounds differ from that of living creatures. For instance, the GM might increase the DC if the undead being treated is in a church of Pharasma or the wounds were caused by powerful vitality energy.
