# Mature Megafauna Companion
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You've raised your megafauna companion to be a more powerful force on the battlefield than most of its kind. The companion you gained through the Mammoth Lord Dedication feat becomes a mature animal companion, granting it additional capabilities. During an encounter, even if you don't use the [[Command an Animal]] action, your megafauna animal companion can still use 1 action on your turn to Stride or Strike.
