# Growth Spell
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You enhance your spell with elemental wood, causing your magic to expand and grow beyond its original limitations. If the next action you use this turn is to Cast a non-cantrip Spell that affects an area, expand the area of the spell. For bursts, expand the radius by 5 feet; for cones, expand the cone by 10 feet; and for lines, expand the length by 15 feet. The spell gains the wood trait.
