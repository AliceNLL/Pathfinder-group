# Double Shot
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** You are wielding a ranged weapon with reload 0.

* * *

You shoot twice in blindingly fast succession. Make two Strikes, each against a separate target and with a â€“2 penalty. Both attacks count toward your multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase until after you've made both of them.
