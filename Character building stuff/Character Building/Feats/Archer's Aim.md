# Archer's Aim
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You slow down, focus, and take a careful shot. Make a ranged Strike with a weapon in the bow weapon group. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the attack roll and ignore the target's [[Concealed]] condition. If the target is [[Hidden]], reduce the flat check from being hidden from 11 to 5.
