# Blind-Fight
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Fighter, Rogue** Your battle instincts make you more aware of [[Concealed]] and [[Invisible]] opponents.

**Ranger** Your heightened senses allow you to instinctively detect unseen opponents.

* * *

You don't need to succeed at a flat check to target concealed creatures. You're not [[Off-Guard]] to creatures that are [[Hidden]] from you (unless you're off-guard to them for reasons other than the hidden condition), and you need only a successful DC 5 flat to target a hidden creature.

While you're adjacent to an [[Undetected]] creature of your level or lower, it is instead only hidden from you.
