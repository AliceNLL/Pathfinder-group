# First Revelation
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You gain your mystery's initial revelation spell. Casting this spell progresses your [[Oracular Curse]]. Use the minor curse from your mystery, but when you progress it again, instead of your mystery's moderate curse effect, you become [[Off-Guard]] in addition to the effects of the minor curse.

If you don't have one, you gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You can [[Refocus]] by reconciling the conflicting nature of your mystery, which also reduces your curse to minor.
