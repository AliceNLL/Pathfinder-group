# Topple Giants
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

When you observe an ally try and fail to execute a strategic maneuver against your enemies, you coordinate with your other allies to finish the job, using the opening from the first attempt to keep your foe off-balance and ensure your eventual success.

When an ally within your overwatch field attempts to [[Disarm]], [[Shove]], or [[Trip]] an opponent within your overwatch field and fails, you coordinate efforts to provide a +2 circumstance bonus to the next Athletics check rolled by a different ally to attempt the same action on the same target before that target's next turn.
