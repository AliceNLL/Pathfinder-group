# Brutish Shove
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** You are wielding a two-handed melee weapon.

* * *

Using the momentum of your last attack to throw your weight into another, you make your opponent stumble back. Make a Strike with a two-handed melee weapon. If you hit a target that is your size or smaller, that creature is [[Off-Guard]] until the end of your current turn, and you can automatically [[Shove]] it, with the same benefits as the Shove action (including the critical success effect, if your Strike was a critical hit). If you move to follow the target, your movement doesn't trigger reactions.

This Strike has the following failure effect.

**Failure** The target becomes [[Off-Guard]] until the end of your current turn.
