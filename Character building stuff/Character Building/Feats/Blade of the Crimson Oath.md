# Blade of the Crimson Oath
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You call upon the Crimson Oath to smite undead and then make a weapon or unarmed Strike against an undead foe. The Strike deals two extra weapon damage dice, and you can convert all the physical damage from the attack into vitality damage.
