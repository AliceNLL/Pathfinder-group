# Great Tengu Form
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You take on the imposing form of a large, winged oni.

Once per day, as part of using Long-Nosed Form, you also gain the benefits of 4th-level _[[Enlarge]]_ and _[[Fly]]_.

This lasts for 5 minutes or until you shift out of your Long-Nosed Form, whichever happens first.
