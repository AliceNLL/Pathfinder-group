# Ultimate Mercy
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your mercy transcends the bounds of life and death.

When you use [[Mercy]], you can cast _[[Lay on Hands]]_ on a creature that died since your last turn to return it to life. The target returns to life with 1 hit point and becomes wounded 1. You can't use Ultimate Mercy if the triggering effect was disintegrate or a death effect.
