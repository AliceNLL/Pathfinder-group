# Worm Empathy
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You can connect with cave worms (and other worm-related creatures, at the GM's discretion) on a rudimentary level. You can use Diplomacy to [[Make an Impression]] on cave worms and to make simple Requests of them. In most cases, the cave worm's starting attitude is indifferent and they will give you time to establish contact.
