# Duskwalker Magic
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your connection to psychopomps gives you the power to glimpse the near future and protect corpses from the ravages of undeath. You can cast _[[Augury]]_and _[[Peaceful Rest]]_ each once per day as 2nd-level divine innate spells.
