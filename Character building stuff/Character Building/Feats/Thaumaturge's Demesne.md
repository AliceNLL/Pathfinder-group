# Thaumaturge's Demesne
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You have claimed an area or location as your demesne, granting you the ability to ward and protect it. When you select this feat, choose a demesne, an area of no more than 2,000 square feet. You must legitimately own the area or, if its a public area, you must lay claim to the area without anyone contesting it.

Once you've chosen your demesne, it's automatically protected by an arcane _[[Peaceful Bubble]]_ spell with an unlimited duration, heightened to half your level rounded up and using your thaumaturge class DC in place of a spell DC, if necessary. Additionally, the demesne is attended by three unseen custodians, as a successful _[[Unseen Custodians]]_ ritual, and one object in the area gains an elemental sentinel, as a successful _[[Elemental Sentinel]]_ ritual.
