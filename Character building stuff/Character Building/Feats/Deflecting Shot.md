# Deflecting Shot
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** An ally within the first range increment of your firearm or crossbow is hit by an attack, and you can see the attacker.

**Requirements** You're wielding a loaded firearm or crossbow.

* * *

You're always ready to take a quick shot to deflect a weapon or distract a foe enough to render them off target. The ally gains a +2 circumstance bonus to their AC against the triggering attack. You use this reaction after the result of the attack roll is revealed, so you know whether the +2 will make a sufficient difference.
