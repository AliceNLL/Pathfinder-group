You've been ensnared by an azata's infectious enthusiasm for life, love, and freedom that manifests as a pearlescent afterimage in your graceful movements, a spring in your soft steps, an ever-present melody in your euphonic voice, and eddies of passionate colors in your mesmerizing eyes. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to checks to [[Make an Impression]], or a +2 circumstance bonus if the target is chaotic good. You gain the [[Set Free]] reaction.
