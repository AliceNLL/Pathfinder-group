# Restorative Strike
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** You have a [[Harm]] or [[Heal]] spell you can cast.

* * *

You balance both sides of the scales, restoring yourself while striking a foe. Cast a 1-action _harm_ or _heal_ spell to heal yourself, expending the spell normally. It loses the manipulate trait when cast this way. Then make a melee Strike. If you make this Strike with your deity's favored weapon, you gain a +1 status bonus to the attack roll.

If the Strike hits, you can target a second willing creature to heal the same amount from the spell. This creature can be outside of the spell's range, provided it's adjacent to the enemy you hit.
