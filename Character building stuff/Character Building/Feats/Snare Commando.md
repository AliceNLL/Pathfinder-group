# Snare Commando
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** A creature fails or critically fails a save against your snare.

* * *

Your snares are so befuddling that your victims rarely notice you slipping out of sight. If you have expert proficiency in Deception, you can Create a Diversion against the triggering creature. If you have expert proficiency in Intimidation, you can instead Demoralize the triggering creature. If you have both, choose one of the two effects.
