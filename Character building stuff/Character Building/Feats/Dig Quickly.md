# Dig Quickly
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** You are standing on dirt, sand, snow, or similar particulate material.

* * *

Your hands work as effectively as shovels when you need to dig a quick hole. You dig a shallow pit in the square you currently occupy, turning the square into difficult terrain (including for you). In addition, you also kick up a cloud of grit in a direction of your choice. The cloud extinguishes small, unattended, non-magical fires and helps smother the flames on burning creatures located within the cone; creatures in this cone that are taking [[Persistent Damage|Persistent Fire Damage]] can immediately attempt an additional flat DC 15 check to end the persistent damage.
