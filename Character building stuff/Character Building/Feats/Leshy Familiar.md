# Leshy Familiar
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You call a minor spirit of nature into a plant body, creating a leshy companion to aid you in your spellcasting. You gain a familiar, which has your choice of either the plant or fungus familiar ability; this doesn't count against your usual limit of familiar abilities (typically 2). The spirit you call has a more tenuous connection to its plant body than fully independent leshies, so it is Tiny in size like other familiars.
