# Linguist Dedication
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You have studied languages and their development. You become trained in Society; if you were already trained in Society, you instead become an expert in Society. You gain the [[Multilingual]] skill feat twice.

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the [[Linguist]] archetype.
