# Rebounding Smite
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** You miss with your Strike during [[Channel Smite]].

* * *

The energy from your smite persists for a moment, allowing you to pass it to a new target. Cast the 1-action version of the [[Harm]] or [[Heal]] spell you expended, targeting a creature other than the target of your Strike.
