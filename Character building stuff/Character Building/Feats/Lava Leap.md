# Lava Leap
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You wreath yourself in molten stone and hurtle toward your enemy. [[Leap]] up to your Speed. At the end of your Leap, a wave of lava crashes onto all creatures in a 10 foot emanation. Each creature in the area takes 1d6 bludgeoning + 2d6 fire  damage, with a DC resolve reflex save against your class DC.

The cooling remains of the lava form a temporary protective shell around you, granting you a +2 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of your next turn.

* * *

**Level (+3)** Each type of damage increases by 1d6.
