# Mockingbird's Disarm
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Frequency** once per minute

**Trigger** You succeed at a check to [[Tumble Through]] or use [[Tumbling Strike]], and you moved through an enemy's space.

* * *

The Mockingbird is a master at running into foes and coming away with their weapons. Mimicking their skill, you strike at a foe's wrist while tumbling past them, weakening their grip. You attempt to [[Disarm]] the enemy whose space you moved through. You can use Acrobatics instead of Athletics for this check.
