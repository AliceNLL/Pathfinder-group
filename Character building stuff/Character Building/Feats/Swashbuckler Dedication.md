# Swashbuckler Dedication
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Choose a [[Swashbuckler's Style|Swashbuckler Style]]. You gain the [[Panache]] class feature, and you can gain panache in all the ways a swashbuckler of your style can.

You become trained in Acrobatics or the skill associated with your style. If you were already trained in both skills, you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in swashbuckler class DC. You don't gain any other effects of your chosen style.

* * *

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the [[Swashbuckler]] archetype.
