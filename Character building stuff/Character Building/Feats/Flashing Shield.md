# Flashing Shield
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** You use the Shield Block reaction, and the opponent that triggered the Shield Block is undead and adjacent to you.

* * *

Your shield flares with holy light as you block the attack, searing the undead with the power of your faith. The triggering undead takes vitality damage equal to half your level and becomes [[Off-Guard]] for 1 round.
