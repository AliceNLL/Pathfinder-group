# Divine Effusion
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

The power of your mystery surges through you like a font of divine energy, even when your own magic dwindles.

Twice per day, you can cast a spell after you've run out of spell slots of the appropriate spell level; the two spells you cast with this feat must be of different spell levels.
