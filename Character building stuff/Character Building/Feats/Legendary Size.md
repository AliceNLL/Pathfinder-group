# Legendary Size
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

The vanaras of old were tricksters able to step across wide rivers or slip into impossibly small spaces. You can cast _[[Enlarge]]_ and _[[Shrink]]_ once per day each as 2nd-level divine innate spells. You can target only yourself and other vanaras with these spells.
