# Forgotten Presence
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

The world conspires to keep you forgotten and unnoticed-memories cloud, ink stains out your name in ledgers, and portraits of you crack and warp over your face. Characters attempting to Recall Knowledge about you take a -2 circumstance penalty. Add _[[Rewrite Memory]]_ to your spell list as a primal spell.
