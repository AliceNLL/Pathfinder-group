![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** A foe within reach attempts to move away from you.

**Requirements** You have a hand free.

* * *

You attempt to snag the foe before they run away. Attempt an Athletics check against the higher of the triggering creature's Athletics DC or Fortitude DC.

* * *

**Critical Success** You disrupt the movement.

**Success** You are able to slow the triggering creature down. It takes a -10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speed for the rest of its triggering movement. This penalty might cause the triggering creature's movement to end immediately based on its affected Speed.

**Failure** As success, but the creature instead takes a -5-foot circumstance penalty to its Speed.
