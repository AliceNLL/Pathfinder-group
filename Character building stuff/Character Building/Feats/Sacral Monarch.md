# Sacral Monarch
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You have come into your full powers and are truly a monarch of your realm, by your own definition at least. While in your territory, you can cast _[[Banishment]]_ and _[[Inevitable Disaster]]_ as innate divine spells, each once per day.
