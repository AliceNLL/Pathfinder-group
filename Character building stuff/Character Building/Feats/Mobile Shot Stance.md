# Mobile Shot Stance
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your shots become nimble and deadly. While you're in this stance, your ranged Strikes don't trigger Reactive Strike or other reactions that are triggered by a ranged attack.

* * *

**Special** If you have [[Reactive Strike]], you can use it with a loaded ranged weapon you're wielding. The triggering creature must be within 5 feet of you for you to do so.
