# Specialized Mount
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You've trained your mount to perform in unusual or even extreme circumstances, granting it abilities far beyond others of its kind. Your mount gains one specialization of your choice.

**Special** You can select this feat up to three times. Each time, add a different specialization to your mount. You mount can't have more than three specializations.
