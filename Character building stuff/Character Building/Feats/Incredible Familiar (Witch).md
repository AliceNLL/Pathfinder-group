# Incredible Familiar (Witch)
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your familiar is imbued with even more magic than other familiars. You can select a base of six familiar or master abilities each day, instead of four.

**Special** Add the bonus familiar abilities you gain for being a witch to this amount.
