# Psychic Rapport
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your telepathic sensitivity intensifies when you're affected by mental magic, making it easier for you to link to other creatures. After you [[Cast a Spell]] with the mental trait, until the start of your next turn, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Deception, Diplomacy, and Intimidation checks, and to Perception checks to [[Sense Motive]].
