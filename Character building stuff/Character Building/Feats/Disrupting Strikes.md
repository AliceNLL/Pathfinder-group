# Disrupting Strikes
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You call forth vitality energy from within to help you destroy undead. Your weapon and unarmed Strikes gain the effects of a _disrupting_ property rune until the start of your next turn.

If you're 14th level or higher, your Strikes instead gain the effects of a _greater disrupting property rune_. The DC for the rune's effect is equal to your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.
