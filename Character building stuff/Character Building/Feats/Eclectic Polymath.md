# Eclectic Polymath

Your flexible mind can quickly shift from one spell to another. If you add a spell to your repertoire during your daily preparations using [[Esoteric Polymath]], when you prepare again, you can choose to keep the new spell from Esoteric Polymath in your repertoire and instead lose access to another spell of the same rank in your repertoire.
