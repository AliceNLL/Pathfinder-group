# Spell Mastery
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You have mastered a handful of spells to such a degree that you can cast them even if you haven't prepared them in advance. Select any four spells of 9th rank or lower that are in your spellbook; each spell you select must be of a different rank. These spells are automatically prepared when you make your daily preparations, and you gain an extra spell slot for each spell. You can select a different combination of spells by spending 1 week of downtime studying your spellbook and retraining your mastered spells.
