# Just One More Thing
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** Your most recent action was to Feint, Request, or Demoralize, and you failed but didn't critically fail.

* * *

After your attempt to influence someone goes poorly, you add another bit of information or ask a pointed question, possibly salvaging your previous attempt.

Reroll the failed check and use the new result. If the target of the failed check is the subject of a lead you're pursuing, double your bonus from [[Pursue a Lead]] on the rerolled check. That creature is temporarily immune to Just One More Thing for 1 day.

You can also use this action if you failed, but didn't critically fail, at a check to Lie, Gather Information, Make an Impression, or Coerce. In this case, rather than spending 1 action, adding Just One More Thing takes you half the amount of time you initially spent on the check, to a minimum of 1 more round.
