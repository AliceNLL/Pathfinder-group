# Right-Hand Blood
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

It's said that the flesh of the right side of a hyena can heal diseases, but that of the left side is poisonous. You can take 2d8 damage to Treat Disease or Treat Wounds; in either case, you don't need healer's tools, and gain a +1 item bonus. Blood from your left side causes the check to critically fail automatically.
