# Touch Focus
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** You begin to Cast a Spell that requires a spell attack roll.

* * *

You can redirect a spell's power through you to deliver it within striking distance. If your next action is to Cast a Spell with 1 or more targets and a range farther than touch, you change the range to touch. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the attack. This only allows you to touch a single target with the spell, even if the spell originally affected more than 1 target. As long as your spell attack is successful, the target is knocked [[Prone]] in addition to the spell's normal effects.
