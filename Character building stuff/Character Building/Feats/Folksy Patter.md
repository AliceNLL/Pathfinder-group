# Folksy Patter
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You are adept at disguising coded messages as folksy idioms. Using slang, jokes, halfling loanwords, and the like, you convey a simple message consisting of three basic words (such as "Danger assassin flee" or "Meet me moonrise"). Your intended listener can attempt a DC 20 perception check against your Deception DC to discern your meaning. Any bonuses or penalties to Perception checks to [[Sense Motive]] apply to checks to understand Folksy Patter.
