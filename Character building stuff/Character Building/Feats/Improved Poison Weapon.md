# Improved Poison Weapon
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You deliver poisons in ways that maximize their harmful effects. When you apply a simple poison with [[Poison Weapon]], the poison deals 2d4 poison damage instead of 1d4 poison damage. You don't waste a poison you apply with Poison Weapon on a critically failed attack roll.
