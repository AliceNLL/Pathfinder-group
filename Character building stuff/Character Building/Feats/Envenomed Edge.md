With a combination of your poison glands and herbal concoctions, you can consistently deliver venomous attacks when you hit an enemy's weak points. When you critically hit using a Strike with a weapon or unarmed attack and deal slashing or piercing damage with that Strike, you deal an additional 1d4 persistent,poison to your target.
