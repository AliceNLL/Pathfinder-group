# Absorb Toxin
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** You attempt a saving throw against a disease or poison effect that affects an area.

* * *

Your skin readily absorbs poison and can consciously draw toxins into your body to spare others. Attempt a counteract check against the triggering effect; your counteract level equals half your level (rounded up), and for the roll use either your class DC -10 or your spellcasting ability modifier plus your spellcasting proficiency bonus. If you counteract the triggering effect, you end the effect for all other creatures in the area; however, you must still save against the effect with a -2 penalty to the initial save.
