# Envenom Strike
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You spit venom onto a weapon you're holding or a weapon held by a willing creature within 30 feet; you can also use this ability to envenom your nagaji fangs unarmed attack. If the next Strike with the chosen weapon before the start of your next turn hits and deals damage, the Strike deals an additional 2d6 poison damage.
