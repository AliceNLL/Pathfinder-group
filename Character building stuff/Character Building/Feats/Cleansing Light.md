# Cleansing Light
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

A burst of light from your horn cleanses your allies of ailments and sends your foes reeling. You and all allies in a 20 foot emanation benefit from a 4th-level _[[Restoration]]_ spell. All enemies within the emanation are [[Dazzled]] until the end of your next turn.
