![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your body can process an alternative to your venom that heals wounds. You can use your [[Envenom]] action to produce a blood restorative instead of vishkanyan venom. You can make a blood restorative at most once per 10 minutes, even if your Envenom action can be used more frequently. You or an adjacent creature can Interact to consume the restorative to regain 5d6 Hit Points instead.
