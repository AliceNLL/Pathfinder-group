# Corpse Stench
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your body exudes an overwhelming scent of decay in a 10 foot emanation, so putrid that it nauseates creates within that range. Any creature that starts its turn in the aura must succeed at a DC resolve fortitude save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher, or be [[Sickened 1]] (plus [[Slowed]] on a critical failure). While within the aura, the creature takes a -2 circumstance penalty to saves against disease and to recover from the sickened condition. A creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune to Corpse Stench for 1 minute.
