# Defensive Coordination
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Like the storied heroes who persist in the face of overwhelming odds, you and your allies will hold the line. If your next action is to cast the rallying anthem composition cantrip, you can Raise a Shield, and one ally of your choice who gains a status bonus from the spell can immediately use their reaction to Raise a Shield.
