# Duo's Aim
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

With assistance from your spotter, you aim for an especially accurate attack. Make a ranged weapon Strike against a foe either within your spotter's melee reach or the first range increment of a ranged weapon your spotter is wielding. On this Strike, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the attack roll and ignore the target's concealment. If you're using a firearm with the kickback trait, you don't take the normal circumstance penalty to this Strike for not having the required Strength score or firing without using a tripod.
