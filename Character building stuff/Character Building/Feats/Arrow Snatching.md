# Arrow Snatching
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You pluck missiles from the air and hurl them back at their source. When you successfully deflect an attack with [[Deflect Arrow]], as part of that reaction, you can immediately make a ranged Strike against the attacker using the projectile you deflected. This is a thrown weapon with the same range increment and effect on a hit as the triggering attack.
