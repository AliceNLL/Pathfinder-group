# Sickening Bite
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your saliva causes severe nausea and mild fever in the living, weakening them so that you can more easily finish them off. When you critically hit a creature with your jaws, the creature is [[Sickened 1]]. This is a disease effect.

If you are satiated, you can end your satiation to make the target [[Sickened 1]] on a regular hit instead.
