# Masterful Companion
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your animal companion shares your incredible hunting skills, allowing it to take down your shared prey with ease. When you [[Hunt Prey]], your animal companion gains the [[Masterful Hunter]] benefit associated with your hunter's edge, rather than just your original hunter's edge benefit.
