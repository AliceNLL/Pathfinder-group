# Share Burden
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** An ally within 60 feet would be affected by a curse or misfortune effect, and you wouldn't be affected but you are an eligible target for the effect.

* * *

You draw the misfortune or curse into yourself, potentially enabling you to enter your curse maelstrom state. Instead of affecting your ally, the triggering curse or misfortune effect affects you.
