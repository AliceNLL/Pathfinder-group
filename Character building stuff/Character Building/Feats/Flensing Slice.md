# Flensing Slice
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** Your last action was a [[Double Slice]], and both attacks hit the target.

* * *

When you hit with both attacks with Double Slice, you flense the target, making it bleed and creating a weak spot.

The target takes 1d8 bleed per weapon damage die of whichever of the weapons you used that has the most weapon damage dice (maximum 4d8 for a _major striking_ weapon).

The target becomes off-guard, and its resistances to any physical damage types are reduced by 5; these two effects last until the beginning of your next turn.
