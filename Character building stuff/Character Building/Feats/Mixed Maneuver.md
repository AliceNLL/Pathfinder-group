# Mixed Maneuver
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You combine two different maneuvers together into a single flowing whole. Choose any two of [[Grapple]], [[Shove]], and [[Trip]]. Attempt both of the attacks you chose against the same or different creatures, but don't apply the multiple attack penalty until after resolving both attacks.
