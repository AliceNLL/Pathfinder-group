# Flower Magic
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Certain magics in the world flow easily through your sap. You can cast _[[Oaken Resilience]]_ and _[[One with Plants]]_ as 2nd-level arcane innate spells once per day each. A tree shape spell you cast this way transforms you into a Large flowering plant like a rosebush or lilac bush instead of a tree.
