# Corpse Tender Dedication
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You have a connection to mindless undead that allows you to communicate your intentions to them on a rudimentary level. You can use Diplomacy to [[Make an Impression]] on mindless undead and to make very simple [[Request|Requests]] of them; their mindless trait doesn't grant immunity to these mental effects. Most mindless undead are likely hostile toward you by default and must be kept at a safe distance to give you time to Make an Impression.

You become trained in Diplomacy; if already trained, you instead become trained in another skill of your choice.

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the [[Corpse Tender]] archetype.
