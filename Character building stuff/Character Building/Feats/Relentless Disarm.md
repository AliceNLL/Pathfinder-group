# Relentless Disarm
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

When you succeed, but don't critically succeed, at a check to Disarm a creature, your circumstance bonus to further checks to Disarm that creature is +4 instead of +2. Other creatures gain only the normal bonus.

When you critically succeed at a Disarm check, you can immediately Demoralize your target as a reaction.
