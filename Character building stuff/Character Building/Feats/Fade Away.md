# Fade Away
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your ability to blend into the background allows you to fade away entirely or appear innocuous even to magical effects. You gain _[[Invisibility]]_ and _[[Disguise Magic]]_ as 2nd-level innate occult spells. You can target only yourself with _invisibility_, and you must be the primary target of _misdirection_. You can cast each spell once per day.
