# Breath Of The Dragon
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You can use a powerful breath weapon, much like the dragon you emulate. You gain the _[[Dragon Breath]]_ sorcerer bloodline spell and a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. If you already have a focus pool, increase your number of Focus Points by 1.
