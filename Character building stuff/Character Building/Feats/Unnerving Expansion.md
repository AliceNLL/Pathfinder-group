# Unnerving Expansion
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You gather your curse around you and impel it to pour outward, expanding your maelstrom. The radius of the emanation of your curse maelstrom state increases by 5 feet until the end of your curse maelstrom state. The outpouring of the curse is unnerving. You attempt to [[Demoralize]] a creature within the emanation of your curse maelstrom; you don't take penalties for not sharing a language with that creature.
