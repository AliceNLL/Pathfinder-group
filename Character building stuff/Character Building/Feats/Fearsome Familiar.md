# Fearsome Familiar
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your elemental familiar trades places with an elemental from its elemental plane. Summon a common creature that has the elemental trait and a level no greater than your level - 4. This creature appears in the same space as your familiar, which disappears for the duration of this impulse. You can Sustain this impulse up to 1 minute. When the impulse ends, the familiar appears in the space the summoned elemental occupied. A familiar can endure this process only so often-if you use this impulse on your familiar more than once per day, it dies as soon as it returns the second time.
