# Reflexive Courage
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** A creature within your reach uses an auditory effect, manipulate action, or move action; makes a ranged attack; or leaves a square during its move action.

**Requirements** You are affected by [[Courageous Anthem]].

* * *

You bellow a ferocious call to arms, inspiring yourself to lash out at a foe. Make a melee Strike against the triggering creature. If the attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a manipulate action, the action is disrupted.
