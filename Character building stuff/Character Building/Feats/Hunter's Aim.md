# Hunter's Aim
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

When you focus on aiming, your attack becomes particularly accurate. Make a ranged weapon Strike against your hunted prey. On this Strike, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the attack roll and ignore your prey's [[Concealed]] condition and any lesser cover.
