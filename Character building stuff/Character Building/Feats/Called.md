# Called

You've heard the Call, and by resisting it, you've developed a bulwark against effects that target your mind. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Will saving throws against mental effects. If you roll a success on your saving throw against a mental effect that would make you [[Controlled]], you get a critical success instead.
