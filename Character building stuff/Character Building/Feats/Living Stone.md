# Living Stone
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your body becomes living stone. You don't need to eat or drink and need only 6 hours of rest to feel well rested. You must still rest at least 8 hours and spend 1 hour of preparation to regain resources usable only a limited number of times per day, such as spell slots. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saving throws against diseases, poisons, and effects that would cause the [[Paralyzed]] or [[Stunned 1|Stunned]] conditions. When you roll a successful saving throw against a disease or poison, you get a critical success instead.
