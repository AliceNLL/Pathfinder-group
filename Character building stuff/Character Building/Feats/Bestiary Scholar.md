You learn how to apply your extensive knowledge of certain creatures using the lore you know. When you gain this feat, choose one of the following skills in which you have attained master proficiency: Arcana, Crafting, Nature, Occultism, or Religion. You can use the chosen skill to Recall Knowledge to identify any creature normally identifiable by any of the above skills. In addition, when you critically succeed at identifying a creature, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your next attack roll or saving throw against that creature.
