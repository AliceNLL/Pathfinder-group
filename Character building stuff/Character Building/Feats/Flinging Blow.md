# Flinging Blow
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You take a moment to center yourself, then unleash a powerful blow that sends your target tumbling away.

Make an unarmed Strike. If you hit, the target must succeed at a Fortitude save against your class DC or be pushed up to 10 feet directly away from you (or 20 feet, on a critical failure) and fall [[Prone]].

If another creature or physical object would prevent this movement, both your target and the blocking creature or object take 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 5 feet of movement that was prevented.
