# Native Waters

You were born with or obtained a special connection to either fresh water or salt water. Once made, this decision can't be changed. Whenever you take your full rest in a natural body of water of the type corresponding to your connection, you recover additional Hit Points equal to your level, and if you have the [[Doomed]] or [[Fatigued]] conditions, you reduce them by 2 instead of 1.
