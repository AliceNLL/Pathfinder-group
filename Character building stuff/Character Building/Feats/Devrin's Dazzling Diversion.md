# Devrin's Dazzling Diversion
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Devrin Arlos has a habit of using whatever is at hand to temporarily blind others in combat. Copying his technique, you make use of your cloak, the light reflecting from your weapon, a handful of flower petals, or some other physical distraction as part of your feint, leaving your opponent unable to see for a moment. When you successfully [[Feint]] a creature, it becomes [[Dazzled]] until the end of your turn. If you critically succeed, the creature is dazzled until the start of your next turn. The creature can use an Interaction to remove the dazzled condition. As normal, you can dazzle only creatures that use vision or a similar sense, as determined by the GM.
