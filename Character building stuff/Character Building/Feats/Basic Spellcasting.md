# Basic Spellcasting
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You increase your ability to cast spells. You gain the [[Spellcasting Archetypes#Basic Spellcasting Feat|Basic Spellcasting Feat]] benefits granted by spellcasting archetypes, gaining a spell repertoire. Each time you gain a spell slot of a new level from the basic, expert, and master spellcasting benefits from pervasive magic feats, add a spell of the appropriate spell rank to your repertoire: a common spell of the magical tradition matching your trait, or another spell of that tradition that you have learned or discovered.
