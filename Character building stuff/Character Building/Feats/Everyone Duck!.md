# Everyone Duck!
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** You fail, but don't critically fail, an attempt to Disable a Device on a trap.

* * *

You intentionally set off the trap, but you take special precautions to protect yourself and your allies from the trap's effects. For the next 2 rounds, if the trap rolls a critical success on an attack roll, it gets a normal success instead, and if anyone rolls a critical failure on their saving throw against the trap, they get a normal failure instead.
