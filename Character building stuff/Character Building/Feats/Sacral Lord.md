# Sacral Lord
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

By right of ritual or sheer stubbornness, you have claimed rulership of the land. Claim a defined territory, such as a small section of forest or river, or a district of a larger city. Within its borders, you can cast _[[Detect Magic]]_, _[[Guidance]]_, and _[[Sigil]]_ as innate divine cantrips, and you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to _[[Make an Impression]]_ on creatures that have the celestial, fiend, fey, monitor, or spirit traits.

**Special** You and your land are linked. Changes to one mirror themselves on the other-if you're depressed, gray rain and clammy mist might set in. These effects have no immediate mechanical impact, but they might give clues about problems afflicting the land.
