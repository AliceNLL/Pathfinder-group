You're skilled with flashy weapons. You are trained with the [[Bo Staff]], [[Dueling Cape]], [[Spiked Chain]], [[Sword Cane]], and [[Whip]].

Whenever you gain a class feature that grants you expert or greater proficiency in a given weapon or weapons, you also gain that proficiency in the weapons listed.
