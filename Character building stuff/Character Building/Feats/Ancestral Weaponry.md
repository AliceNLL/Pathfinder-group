# Ancestral Weaponry
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You blend monastic techniques with the ancestral fighting styles of your people. Choose an ancestry for which you have access to all weapons with that trait. For you, melee weapons with that ancestry trait and either the agile or finesse trait gain the monk trait.
