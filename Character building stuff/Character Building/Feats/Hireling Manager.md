![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You are able to find and secure better labor than most. When securing a hireling for a service, that hireling gains a +2 circumstance bonus to all skill checks. This circumstance bonus applies to both trained and untrained hirelings and has no effect on the cost of the service or labor provided.
