# Ricochet Feint
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

While in [[Ricochet Stance (Rogue)|Ricochet Stance]], you can bounce a thrown weapon off a foe to distract them. You can attempt a [[Feint]] against a creature within the first range increment of a thrown weapon you are wielding, rather than only creatures within your melee reach.
