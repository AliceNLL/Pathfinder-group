# Roll with It
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** A foe hits you with a melee weapon or unarmed attack.

* * *

When you take a big hit, your foe bounces you around like a rubber ball, but you escape the worst of the blow. Your foe can move you any distance of its choice up to 30 feet in a direction of its choice (this is not forced movement, and it triggers reactions as normal). You fall [[Prone]] and are [[Stunned 1]]. Attempt a DC 6 flat. On a success, you take minimum damage from the attack, and on a critical success, if the attack was a critical hit, you don't take double damage from the critical hit.
