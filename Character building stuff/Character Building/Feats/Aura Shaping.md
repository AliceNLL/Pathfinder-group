# Aura Shaping
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You control the size of your kinetic aura. You can make your kinetic aura's emanation any size from a 5 foot emanation to a 20 foot emanation (you must choose a multiple of 5). You choose the size when you Channel Elements and can change it when you use a stance impulse that affects your kinetic aura. Increase the maximum size you can choose by 5 feet at 15th and 20th levels.
