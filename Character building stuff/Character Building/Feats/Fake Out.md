# Fake Out
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** An ally is about to use an action that requires an attack roll, targeting a creature within your weapon's first range increment.

**Requirements** You're wielding a loaded firearm or crossbow.

* * *

With a skilled flourish of your weapon, you force an enemy to acknowledge you as a threat. Make an attack roll to [[Aid]] the triggering attack. If you dealt damage to that enemy with the same weapon since the start of your last turn, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to this roll.
