# True Gaze
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Frequency** once per hour

* * *

When you focus your eyes carefully, your gaze can pierce through all obfuscations, even magical ones. When you use True Gaze, you gain the effects of a 6th-level _[[Truesight]]_ spell, using your Perception modifier for the counteract check.
