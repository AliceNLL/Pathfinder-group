# Shatter Defenses
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** A frightened creature is in your melee reach.

* * *

Your offense exploits your enemy's fear. Make a melee Strike against a frightened creature. If you hit and deal damage, the target becomes [[Off-Guard]] until its frightened condition ends. If the target was already off-guard to you when you damaged it with this Strike, it can't reduce its frightened value below 1 until the start of your next turn.
