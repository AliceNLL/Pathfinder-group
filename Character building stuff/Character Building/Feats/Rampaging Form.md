# Rampaging Form
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Once per day, when you Change Shape into a fox, you can instead gain the effects of both the canine form of 5th-level _[[Animal Form]]_ and 7th-level _[[Fiery Body]]_ for 1 minute or until you shift back, whichever comes first. You can cast _[[Produce Flame]]_ from the _fiery body_ effect even though you're in a battle form.

* * *

**Special** If you are a frozen wind kitsune, your form is ice instead of fire. This changes the immunity and damage from the _fiery body_ effect to cold, changes the weakness to fire, and changes produce flame to _[[Ray of Frost]]_.
