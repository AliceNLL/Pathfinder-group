# Reclaim Spell
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You have learned to manipulate reflections of magic, similar to the resonant reflections. You reclaim the magic of an ongoing spell, using it reprepare a spell with a duration.

You Dismiss a Spell of 4th level or lower that you cast today from a spell slot with at least half its duration remaining, even if that spell can't normally be Dismissed.

You can then spend 10 minutes to reprepare the spell in that spell slot, as [[Reprepare Spell]].
