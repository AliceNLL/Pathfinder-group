# Redirect Attention
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Through your strong connection with your progenitor, you're able to redirect those attempting to spy on you. Whenever you would be directly targeted with a scrying effect, the effect must attempt a counteract check against the higher of your spell DC or class DC. If the check fails, the effect targets your progenitor instead of you.
