# Forager
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

While using Survival to Subsist, if you roll any result worse than a success, you get a success. On a success, you can provide subsistence living for yourself and four additional creatures, and on a critical success, you can take care of twice as many additional creatures. You can choose to support half the number of creatures with a comfortable living.

Increase the number of additional creatures you feed on a success to eight if you're an expert in Survival, 16 if you're a master, and 32 if you're legendary.
