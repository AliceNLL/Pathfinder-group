# Cut from the Air
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** You are the target of a physical ranged Strike.

**Requirements** You're aware of the attack, not [[Off-Guard]] against it, and either have a hand free or are wielding a melee weapon.

* * *

You can knock aside ranged attacks. You gain a +4 circumstance bonus to AC against the triggering attack. If the attack misses, you knocked or cut it out of the air.
