# Greater Magical Edification
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You've continued to expand your compendium of tools to compile knowledge. You can cast _[[Translate]]_, _[[Mindlink]]_, and _[[Secret Page]]_ as innate occult spells, each once per day. When you cast _secret page_, it is automatically heightened to the same spell level as your cantrips from Magical Edification.
