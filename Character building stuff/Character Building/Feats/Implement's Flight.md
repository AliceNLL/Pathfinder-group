# Implement's Flight
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

By weakening your relation to the ground and strengthening your relation to the sky, you've learned to soar through the air, your implement carrying you as surely as any broomstick or pestle. As long as you're holding a thaumaturge implement, you gain a fly Speed equal to your land Speed.
