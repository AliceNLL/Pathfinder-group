# Tumble Behind (Rogue)
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You tumble under and behind your foe, your rapid movement letting you catch them off guard. When you successfully [[Tumble Through]], the foe whose space you passed through is [[Off-Guard]] against the next attack you make before the end of your turn.
