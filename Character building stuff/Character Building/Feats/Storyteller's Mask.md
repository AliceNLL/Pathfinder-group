# Storyteller's Mask
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your mask remembers the stories of Shifting Frog, Storyteller of the Past and Future. You can cast _[[Foresight]]_ once per day as an innate spell, either arcane if you have Wizard Dedication or primal if you have Druid Dedication, but the duration is 10 minutes instead of 1 hour. Immediately after you Cast a non-cantrip Spell that targets only a single foe, you can Recall Knowledge about that foe.
