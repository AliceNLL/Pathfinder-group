# Surprise Snare
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You install one of your snares prepared for quick deployment in a space that's occupied by an opponent. It must be a snare that normally takes 1 minute or less to [[Craft]].

The snare automatically triggers, but it takes a -2 circumstance penalty to any applicable save DC, as well as any attack rolls or other checks the snare attempts.
