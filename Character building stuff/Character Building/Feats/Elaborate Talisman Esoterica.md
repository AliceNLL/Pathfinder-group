![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

As you continue to collect talismanic esoterica, you improve your ability to create temporary talismans. You can create four temporary talismans each day instead of two.

**Special** You can select this feat a second time if you are 14th level or higher, allowing you to create six talismans each day instead of four.
