# Experienced Tracker
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Tracking is second nature to you, and when necessary you can follow a trail without pause. You can [[Track]] while moving at full Speed by taking a –5 penalty to your Survival check. If you're a master in Survival, you don't take the –5 penalty. If you're legendary in Survival, you no longer need to roll a new Survival check every hour when tracking, though you still need to roll whenever there are significant changes in the trail.
