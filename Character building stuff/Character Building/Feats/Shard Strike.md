# Shard Strike
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Jagged metal shards form in the air and lash out from you. You choose shards or spines, which changes the area, damage type, and critical failure effect. Each creature in the area attempts a DC resolve reflex, and a creature that critically fails is [[Clumsy 1]] until the start of your next turn.

* * *

**Level (+2)** The damage increases by 1d6.
