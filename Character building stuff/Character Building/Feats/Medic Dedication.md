# Medic Dedication
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You become an expert in Medicine.

When you succeed with [[Battle Medicine]] or [[Treat Wounds]], the target regains 5 additional HP at DC 20, 10 HP at DC 30, or 15 HP at DC 40.

Once per day, you can use Battle Medicine on a creature that's temporarily immune. If you're a master in Medicine, you can do so once per hour.

* * *

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you gain two other feats from the [[Medic]] archetype.
