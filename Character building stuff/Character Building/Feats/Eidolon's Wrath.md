# Eidolon's Wrath
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your eidolon gains the _eidolon's wrath_ focus spell, which it casts, instead of you. You determine the damage type when you gain the feat: acid, cold, electricity, fire, sonic, vitality, or void. If your eidolon is a celestial, fiend, or monitor with an alignment other than true neutral, you can choose a damage type in its alignment.

Increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1. As normal, your eidolon shares your Focus Points.
