# Martial Artist Dedication
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You have trained to use your fists as deadly weapons. The damage die for your fist unarmed attacks becomes `dice: 1d6` instead of `dice: 1d4`. You don't take the -2 circumstance penalty for making a lethal attack with your nonlethal unarmed attacks.

Whenever you gain a class feature that grants you expert or greater proficiency in certain weapons, you also gain that proficiency rank in all unarmed attacks.

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the [[Martial Artist]] archetype.
