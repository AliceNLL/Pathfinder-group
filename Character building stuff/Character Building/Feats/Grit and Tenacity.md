# Grit and Tenacity
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Frequency** once per hour

**Trigger** You fail a Fortitude or Will save.

* * *

You call upon deep reserves of toughness and mental fortitude to power through an otherwise debilitating effect. Reroll the triggering save with a +2 circumstance bonus; you must use the second result.
