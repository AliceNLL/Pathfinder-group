# Improved Communal Healing
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You can direct excess channeled energy outward to benefit an ally.

You can grant the Hit Points you would regain from [[Communal Healing]] to any one creature within the range of your heal spell instead of yourself. You can also use Communal Healing when you target only yourself with a _heal_ spell, though if you do, you must grant the additional healing to someone other than yourself.
