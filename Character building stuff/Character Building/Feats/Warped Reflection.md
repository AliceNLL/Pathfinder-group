# Warped Reflection
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Frequency** once per minute

* * *

Due to your origins, your form is more flexible than most. You shift your appearance to resemble a creature within 30 feet but with an unsettling, horrifying twist. Though this transformation is momentary, witnessing it gives the target deep existential dread. It must succeed at a DC resolve will save against the higher of your class DC or spell DC or become [[Frightened|Frightened 1]] ([[Frightened|Frightened 2]] on a critical failure) and be [[Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] as long as the frightened condition lasts. Once you've used Warped Reflection against a creature, it's temporarily immune for 24 hours.
