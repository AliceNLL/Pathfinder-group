# Bastion Dedication
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You are particularly skilled at using a shield in combat. You gain the [[Reactive Shield]] feat. This fulfills any prerequisites requiring Reactive Shield as normal.

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the [[Bastion]] archetype.
