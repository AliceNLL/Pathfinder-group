# Deep Freeze
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You vent a jet of supercooled fluid from your innovation, damaging a foe and slowing it down. Target one creature within 60 feet. That creature takes cold damage equal to your level, with effects depending on its DC resolve reflex save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target takes half damage and takes a -5-foot status penalty to its Speeds for 1 round.

**Failure** The target takes full damage and takes a -10-foot status penalty to its Speeds for 1 round.

**Critical Failure** The target takes double damage, is [[Slowed]] for 1 round, and takes a -15-foot status penalty to its Speeds for 1 round.

**Unstable Function** Your innovation discharges an enormous cone of supercooled fluid, potentially causing cascading failures. Add the unstable trait to Deep Freeze. The ability affects all creatures within a 60 foot cone instead of a single target, and it deals cold damage equal to double your level instead of equal to your level.

If you have the revolutionary innovation class feature, you can choose a 60 foot cone or a 90 foot cone when you use an unstable Deep Freeze.

DC 17 flat{Unstable Check}

**Special** If your innovation is a minion, it can take this action rather than you.
