# Molten Wire
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Spinning molten iron through a vortex of fire, you trap your foe in searing wires. Make an impulse attack roll against a creature within 15 feet. On a success, the target takes 2d6 slashing damage and is wrapped in molten wire for 1 minute. It is Clumsy 1 and takes 2d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns, with a basic Reflex save. The wire's Escape DC is your class DC. The wire has AC 10 and 75 HP. The impulse ends if the creature Escapes or the wire is destroyed.

* * *

**Level (+4)** The slashing damage increases by 1d6, the fire damage increases by 1d4, and the wire's HP increases by 25.
