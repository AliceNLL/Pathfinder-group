**Frequency** once per day

**Requirements** You haven't yet acted on your turn.

You call upon your Cascade Bearer training to help you adjust a spell for the current situation. Until the end of your turn, you gain a single metamagic feat from the druid class or the wizard class that has a level requirement of no more than half your level.
