![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You've reinforced your interior parts with sealant or other flame-retardant materials, protecting you from fire. You no longer have the weakness to fire from the flammable ability.

**Special** You can't take this feat if you're a stuffed poppet.
