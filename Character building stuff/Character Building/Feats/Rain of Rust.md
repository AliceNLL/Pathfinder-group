# Rain of Rust
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You conjure a red raincloud in a 10 foot burst within 60 feet, which pours rust-colored rain directly below it. Any creature in the rain with the metal trait, that is made of metal, or is wearing metal armor is covered in corrosive build-up. Any such creature is [[Clumsy 1]] as long as it remains in the area. If such a creature is in the rain at the start of its turn, it takes 3d6 damage with a DC 0 Basic Fortitude save against your class DC, plus 1d6 persistent untyped damage if it fails. Damage from this impulse ignores Hardness.

* * *

**Level (+2)** The initial damage increases by 1d6.
