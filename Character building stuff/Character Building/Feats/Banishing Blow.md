# Banishing Blow
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** You use your champion's reaction, triggered by a fiend within your reach.

* * *

The erratic teleportation magic you experienced in the Kortos Mounts has taught you a few tricks. You attempt an Athletics check to [[Shove]] the fiend that triggered your champion's reaction; on a success, the target can't teleport or summon creatures for 1 minute. On a critical success, the target is also [[Stunned 1]] and can't teleport or summon creatures for 1 hour, and if you are on your home plane and the target is a fiend of level 18 or lower from another plane, it is also banished to its home plane. Your multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this attack.
