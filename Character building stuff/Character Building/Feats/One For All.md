# One For All
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

With precisely the right words of encouragement, you bolster an ally's efforts.

Designate an ally within 30 feet; this action counts as sufficient preparation to [[Aid]] that ally. When you use the Aid reaction to help that ally, you can roll Diplomacy in place of the usual check.

If your swashbuckler's style is wit and your diplomacy check to Aid meets or exceeds the very hard DC for your level, you gain [[Panache]].
