# Disorienting Venom
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

The venom injected by your fangs disorients your foes. A creature damaged by your [[Anadi Venom]] must attempt a DC resolve fortitude save against your class or spell DC, whichever is higher, or become [[Off-Guard]] for 1 round.
