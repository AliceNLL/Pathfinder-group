# Adapted Cantrip
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Through study of multiple magical traditions, you've altered a spell to suit your spellcasting style. Choose one cantrip from a magical tradition other than your own. If you prepare spells, you can choose this spell when you prepare your cantrips, in addition to your other options. If you have a spell repertoire, replace one of your cantrips known with the chosen spell. You can cast this cantrip as a spell of your class's tradition.

If you swap or retrain this cantrip later, you can choose its replacement from the same alternate tradition or a different one.
