# Tongue Tether
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your tongue can momentarily latch on as readily as your hands. So long as you can freely open your mouth, you do not need free hands in order to [[Disarm]], [[Grab an Edge]], or [[Trip]].

If you have the [[Long Tongue]] feat, you can Disarm, Grab an Edge, and Trip with your tongue at a distance that is 5 feet beyond your normal reach.
