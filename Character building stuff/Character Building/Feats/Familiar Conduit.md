# Familiar Conduit
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** You have line of effect to your familiar.

* * *

Under your tutelage, your familiar has grown attuned to the hidden currents of the world and can serve as a conduit for your magic. If the next action you use is to [[Cast a Spell]] that has a range, the spell uses the familiar as its origin point.
