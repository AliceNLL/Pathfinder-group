# Crane Flutter
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** You are targeted with a melee attack by an attacker you can see.

**Requirements** You are in [[Crane Stance]].

* * *

You interpose your arm between yourself and your opponent. Your circumstance bonus to AC from Crane Stance increases to +3 against the triggering attack. If the attack misses you, you can immediately make a crane wing Strike against the attacker at a -2 penalty, even if the attacker isn't within your reach.
