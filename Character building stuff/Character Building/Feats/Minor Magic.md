# Minor Magic
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You've dabbled in minor magical abilities. Choose arcane, divine, occult, or primal magic, and gain two cantrips from the common cantrips that are available in that tradition. You gain the [[Cast a Spell]] activity, your key spellcasting ability is Charisma, and you're trained in spell attack rolls and DCs for the tradition you chose.
