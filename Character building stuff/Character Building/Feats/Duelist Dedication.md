# Duelist Dedication
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You are always ready to draw your weapon and begin a duel, no matter the circumstances. You gain the [[Quick Draw]] ranger feat, enabling you to both draw and attack with a weapon as 1 action. This serves as Quick Draw for the purpose of meeting prerequisites.

**Special** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the [[Duelist]] archetype.
