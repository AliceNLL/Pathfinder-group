# Steady Spellcasting (Magus)
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Confident in your technique, you don't easily lose your concentration when you Cast a Spell.

If a reaction would disrupt your spellcasting action, attempt a DC 15 flat check. If you succeed, your action isn't disrupted.
