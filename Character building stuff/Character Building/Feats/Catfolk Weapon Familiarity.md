You favor weapons that you can use with quick, darting slashes like a cat's claws. You are trained with the [[Hatchet]], [[Kama]], [[Kukri]], [[Scimitar]], and [[Sickle]].

In addition, you gain access to kama, kukris, and all uncommon catfolk weapons. For you, martial catfolk weapons are simple weapons and advanced catfolk weapons are martial weapons.
