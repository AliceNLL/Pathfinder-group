# Sepulchral Sublimation
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** You have at least one undead minion that you permanently control.

* * *

You repurpose the void energy that flows through your minions at a moment's notice. Instantly destroy one undead minion within 60 feet that is permanently under your control. If your next action is to cast a necromancy spell from a spell slot, you don't expend the slot. The spell's level must be half the destroyed minion's level or lower and the spell can't have a duration.

**Special** This feat has the trait matching your spellcasting tradition.
