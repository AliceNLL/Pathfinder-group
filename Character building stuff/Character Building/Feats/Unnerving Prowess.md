# Unnerving Prowess
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** You critically succeed at a Strike or Disarm with your Aldori dueling sword.

* * *

Your incredible skill with your blade unnerves your foes. You attempt to [[Demoralize]] the target of your Strike or [[Disarm]]. This Demoralize attempt does not have the auditory trait, nor do you take a penalty to the check if the target doesn't understand your language.
