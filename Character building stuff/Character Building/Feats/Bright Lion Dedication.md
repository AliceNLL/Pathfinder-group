# Bright Lion Dedication
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Access** [[Bright Lion]] background

* * *

You become trained in your choice of Deception or Diplomacy and in Mzali Lore; if you were already trained, you become an expert instead. You incorporate enough worship of Walkena in your daily life to avoid suspicion. You typically don't need to [[Lie]] or [[Impersonate]] to pass yourself off as a worshipper of Walkena. Against careful inspection, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to Deception checks specifically to pass yourself off as a version of yourself faithful to Walkena.

* * *

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the [[Bright Lion]] archetype.
