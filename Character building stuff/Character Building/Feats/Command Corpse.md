# Command Corpse
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You gain the [[Command Undead]] feat, but you can use it only to transform the effects of _[[Harm]]_ spells you cast on mindless undead. These spells can control creatures with a level equal to or lower than your level -1 (instead of your level - 3).
