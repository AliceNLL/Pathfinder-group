# Statue
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your body and equipment appear to be made of stone as you hold perfectly still. Until the next time you act, you appear to be a statue and do not need to eat, drink, or breathe, but you are [[Off-Guard]]. Your Deception DC to pass as a statue is equal to 10 + your proficiency bonus (do not apply any other bonuses, penalties, or modifiers).
