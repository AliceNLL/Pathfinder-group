# Expert Skysage Divination
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your studies of the stars have taught you about the mysteries of the cosmos. You learn a 4th-level spell from any spell list. At 12th level, you learn a 5th-level spell, and at 14th level, you learn a 6th-level spell. Each of these spells must come from the divination school. You become an expert with spell attack rolls and spell DCs for occult spells.
