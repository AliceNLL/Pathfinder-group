# Dream Magic
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You learn dream-related magic to aid your studies. Choose _[[Dream Message]]_ or _[[Sleep]]_ upon taking this feat; you learn this spell as a 4th-level innate occult spell. If you choose sleep, you can cast the spell only while in a Daydream Trance. You become trained in occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs, and your spellcasting ability for these spells is Wisdom.

**Special** You can take this feat twice, gaining the spell you didn't select initially the second time.
