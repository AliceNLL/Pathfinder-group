# Ward Medic
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You've studied in large medical wards, treating several patients at once and tending to all their needs. When you use [[Treat Disease]] or [[Treat Wounds]], you can treat up to two targets. If you're a master in Medicine, you can treat up to four targets, and if you're legendary, you can treat up to eight targets.
