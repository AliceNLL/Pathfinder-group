![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** Your eidolon has a creature [[Grabbed]] or [[Restrained]].

Your eidolon constricts the creature, dealing bludgeoning damage equal to your eidolon's level plus its Strength modifier, with a basic Fortitude save against your spell DC.
