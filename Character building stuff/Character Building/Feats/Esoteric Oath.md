# Esoteric Oath
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You've sworn an oath to slay the alien abominations that lurk in the remote corners of Golarion and prey on the weak. You gain following edict: "You must slay aberrations whose actions are in direct opposition to your deity's edicts when you encounter them as long as you have a reasonable chance of success."

Your Retributive Strike gains a +4 circumstance bonus to damage against an aberration, or +6 if you have master proficiency with the weapon you used.

Your Glimpse of Redemption's resistance against damage from an aberration is 7 + your level.

If you use [[Liberating Step]] triggered by an aberration, your ally gains a +4 circumstance bonus to checks granted by your Liberating Step, and the ally can Step twice afterward.

You don't consider aberrations whose actions are in direct opposition to your deity's edicts to be legitimate authorities, even in nations they rule.
