# Tempest-Sun Shielding
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** You or an ally within 30 feet takes damage.

* * *

You transform unrealized spell energy into a protective shield. If you're a spontaneous spellcaster, expend a spell slot; if you're a prepared spellcaster, expend a spell prepared in a spell slot. Reduce the triggering damage by an amount equal to four times the level of the expended slot or spell.
