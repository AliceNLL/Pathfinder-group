# Very Sneaky
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Taller folk rarely pay attention to the shadows at their feet, and you take full advantage of this. You can move 5 feet farther when you take the [[Sneak]] action, up to your Speed.

In addition, as long as you continue to use Sneak actions and succeed at your Stealth check, you don't become observed if you don't have cover or greater cover and aren't [[Concealed]] at the end of the Sneak action, as long as you have cover or greater cover or are concealed at the end of your turn.
