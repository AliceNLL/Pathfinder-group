# Rogue Dedication
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You gain a skill feat and the rogue's [[Surprise Attack]] class feature. You become trained in light armor. In addition, you become trained in Stealth or Thievery plus one skill of your choice; if you are already trained in both Stealth and Thievery, you become trained in an additional skill of your choice. You become trained in rogue class DC.

**Special** You cannot gain another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the [[Rogue]] archetype.
