# Plant Shape
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You can take the shape of a plant creature. If you don't have untamed form, you can cast [[Plant Form]] once per day, heightened to the same rank as your highest-rank druid spell slot.

If you do have [[Untamed Form]], add the shapes listed in [[Plant Form]] to your [[Untamed Form]] list, and whenever you're polymorphed into another shape using untamed form, you gain resistance 5 to poison.
