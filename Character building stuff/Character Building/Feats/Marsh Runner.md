# Marsh Runner
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You are adept at moving through marshy terrain. When you use the [[Step]] action, you can ignore difficult terrain caused by flooding, swamps, or quicksand. In addition, when you use the Acrobatics skill to [[Balance]] on narrow surfaces or uneven marshy ground, you aren't [[Off-Guard]], and if you roll a success on the Acrobatics check, you get a critical success instead.
