# Opportune Backstab
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** A creature within your melee reach is hit by a melee attack from one of your allies.

* * *

When your enemy is hit by your ally, you capitalize upon the distraction. Make a Strike against the triggering creature.
