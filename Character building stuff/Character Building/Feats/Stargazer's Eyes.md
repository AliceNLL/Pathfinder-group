# Stargazer's Eyes

Long hours in darkened observatories have sharpened your senses. If you don't have low-light vision or darkvision, you gain low-light vision, or if you already have low-light vision, you gain darkvision.

**Special** You can take this feat a second time, upgrading your low-light vision to darkvision.
