# Living Monolith Dedication
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Access** You are from the Golden Road region.

* * *

You've begun to inscribe a magical stone called a _ka stone_ that you will some day tie to your soul. You gain knowledge of Ancient Osirion and a connection to your nascent _ka stone_. If you fail a recovery check while dying, your dying condition does not increase; if you critically fail, your dying condition increases by only 1. You become trained in Ancient Osirion Lore, or expert if you were already trained.

* * *

**Special** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the [[Living Monolith]] archetype.
