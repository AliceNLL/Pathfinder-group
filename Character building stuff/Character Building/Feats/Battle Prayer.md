# Battle Prayer
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Calling out to your deity, you recite scripture to harm a foe. When you select this feat, choose chaos, evil, good, or law. Your choice must match one of your deity's alignment components. This action has the trait corresponding to the chosen alignment.

Attempt a religion check against the Will DC of a foe within 30 feet. The foe is then temporarily immune to Battle Prayers from your deity for 1 day.

* * *

**Critical Success** You deal `dice: 2d6` damage of the chosen alignment type, or `dice: 6d6` damage if you have legendary proficiency in Religion.

**Success** You deal `dice: 1d6` damage of the chosen alignment type, or `dice: 3d6` damage if you have legendary proficiency in Religion.

**Failure** There is no effect.

**Critical Failure** The backlash of your foe's will against your prayer prevents you from using Battle Prayer again for 10 minutes.
