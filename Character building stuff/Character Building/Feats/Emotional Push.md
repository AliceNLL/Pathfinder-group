# Emotional Push
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** An enemy you're aware of fails its save against an emotion spell.

* * *

You prepare to take advantage of your enemy's sudden change in emotions. The target is [[Off-Guard]] against your next attack before the end of your next turn.
