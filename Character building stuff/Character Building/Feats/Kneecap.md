# Kneecap
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You deliver a punishing blow to an enemy's knee, shin, or other vulnerable anatomy within your reach. Make a melee Strike with a melee weapons or melee unarmed attack. This attack doesn't deal damage. On a hit, the target takes a –10-foot status penalty to its Speed (or a –15-foot status penalty on a critical hit). The penalty lasts for 1 round. This penalty applies only if the target has a land Speed and depends on legs or other targetable appendages to use its land Speed. As with all penalties to Speed, this can't reduce a creature's Speed below 5 feet.
