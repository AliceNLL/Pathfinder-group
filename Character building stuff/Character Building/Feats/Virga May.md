# Virga May
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Born of a storm hag, you have one crystal-blue or rain-gray eye. You share your mother's power over wind and storm. You can cast _[[Electric Arc]]_ as an occult innate cantrip. As normal, a cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up.
