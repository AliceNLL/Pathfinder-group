# Golem Grafter Dedication
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your flesh has been specially treated with the same arcane and alchemical processes used to toughen the skin of flesh golems. Increase your maximum Hit Points by an amount equal to your level. You gain resistance to physical damage (except adamantine) equal to your number of class feats from the golem grafter archetype.

**Special** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the [[Golem Grafter]] archetype.
