# Natural Illusionist
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

By drawing upon the First World's magic, you can siphon a portion of that malleable world to create a convincing illusion. Once per day, you can cast _[[Illusory Disguise]]_, _[[Item Facade]]_, or _[[Ventriloquism]]_. At 7th level, the spell is heightened to 2nd level, and every 2 levels thereafter, the spell is heightened an additional spell level.
