# Nimble Shield Hand
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You are so used to wielding a shield that you can do so even while using the hand that's holding it for other purposes.

The hand you use to wield a shield counts as a free hand for the purposes of the [[Interact]] action. You can also hold another object in this hand (but you still can't use it to wield a weapon).

This benefit doesn't apply to tower shields, which are still too cumbersome.
