# Unrivaled Builder
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Building things is like solving a puzzle, and you know how to use anything at your disposal to get the job done. You gain _[[Creation]]_ as a 5th-level innate primal spell. You must have an equivalent Bulk of material to create an item, such as wood or scrap metal to make a wheelbarrow. You can cast this spell once each day.
