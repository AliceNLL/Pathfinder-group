# Malleable Movement
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** You Leap.

* * *

You shift the shape of your weapon to help you Leap farther and faster. You shift your weapon into a long flexible pole, climbing hook, or similar aid, adding an extra 5 feet to the distance you're able to Leap. As normal, this can't increase the distance of your Leap beyond your Speed.
