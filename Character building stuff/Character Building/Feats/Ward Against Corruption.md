# Ward Against Corruption
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your soul is warded against the power of undeath and plague, as well as that of the evil former psychopomps known as sahkils. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against death effects, disease, and all effects from undead or sahkils. This bonus increases to +2 against an undead or sahkil's death effect or disease.
