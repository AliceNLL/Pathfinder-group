# Ever-Vigilant Senses
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your eidolon has enhanced senses. It gains a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception, and can't be flanked except by creatures that are higher level than it.

It can see [[Invisible]] creatures and objects; they appear translucent and are [[Concealed]].

When your eidolon moves within 30 feet of an illusion that can be disbelieved, the GM rolls a secret check to disbelieve it, even if your eidolon didn't spend an action to Interact.
