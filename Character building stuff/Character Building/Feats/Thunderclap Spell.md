# Thunderclap Spell
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your lightning splits the air, generating a booming shock wave. If your next action is to Cast a Spell that has the electricity trait or deals electricity damage, has no duration, and requires creatures to attempt a saving throw, the force of the spell's lightning creates a thunderclap, in addition to its other effects. Each creature that failed its Reflex save against the spell is [[Deafened]] for 1 round, and those who critically failed are also knocked [[Prone]].
