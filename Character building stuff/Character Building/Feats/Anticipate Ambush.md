# Anticipate Ambush
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You keep watch for any [[Hidden]] creatures or dangerous sites, moving at half your travel Speed. If you're Anticipating an Ambush at the start of an encounter, you roll a Perception check for initiative, and all enemies rolling Stealth for initiative take a â€“2 circumstance penalty to their Stealth checks.
