# Fiery Retort
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** An opponent adjacent to you hits you with a melee weapon or a melee unarmed attack.

**Frequency** once per minute

* * *

Ignoring your pain, you sear your attacker with a wave of flame. The triggering opponent takes fire damage equal to your level.
