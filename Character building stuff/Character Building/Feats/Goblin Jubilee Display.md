# Goblin Jubilee Display
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Flames and explosions sear the air in a riot of color and devastation that rivals that wrought by even the wildest goblin party. The display is both so beautiful and chaotic that, while mesmerizing, it poses a significant risk to the physical health, sight, and hearing of anyone who gets too close. You gain the [[Goblin Jubilee]] fireworks display.
