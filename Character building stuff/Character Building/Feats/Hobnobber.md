You are skilled at learning information through conversation. The [[Gather Information]] exploration activity takes you half as long as normal (typically reducing the time to 1 hour). If you're a master in Diplomacy and roll a critical failure to Gather Information, you get a failure instead. There is still no guarantee that a rumor you learn with Gather Information is accurate.
