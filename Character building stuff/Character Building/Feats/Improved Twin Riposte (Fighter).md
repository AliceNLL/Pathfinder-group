# Improved Twin Riposte (Fighter)
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your weapons are a blur, blocking and biting at your foes. You can use [[Twin Riposte]] even if you aren't benefiting from [[Twin Parry]]. At the start of each of your turns, you gain an additional reaction that you can use only to make a Twin Riposte.
