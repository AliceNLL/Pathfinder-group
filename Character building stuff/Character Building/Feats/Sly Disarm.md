# Sly Disarm
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You can [[Disarm]] a creature through sleight of hand rather than brute force. You can use Thievery instead of Athletics when you attempt a Disarm. When you use Thievery to attempt a Disarm and succeed, the target is [[Off-Guard]] against the next attack you make before the end of your turn.
