# Exploit Opening
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** Your spotter critically succeeds at a Strike against a creature, and that creature is within your ranged weapon's first range increment.

* * *

You take advantage of your spotter's devastating attack to unleash your own follow-up attack. Make a ranged Strike with a -2 penalty against the target of the triggering attack. This Strike doesn't count toward your multiple attack penalty and your multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to the Strike.
