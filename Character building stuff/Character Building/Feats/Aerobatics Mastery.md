# Aerobatics Mastery
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You move with grace in flight and can perform amazing aerial stunts.

You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Acrobatics checks to [[Maneuver in Flight]] and can combine two maneuvers into a single action, such as reversing direction while making a steep ascent or descent or hovering in gale-force winds. The DC of the Acrobatics check is equal to the DC of the most difficult maneuver + 5.

If you're legendary in Acrobatics, you can combine three such maneuvers into a single action; the DC of the Acrobatics check is equal to the DC of the most difficult maneuver + 10. Regardless of the combination, these maneuvers rarely allow you to move farther than your [[Fly]] Speed.
