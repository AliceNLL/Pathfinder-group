# Steel Yourself!
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You encourage an ally to toughen up, giving them a fighting chance. Choose one ally within your marshal's aura. The ally gains temporary Hit Points equal to your Charisma modifier and a +2 circumstance bonus to Fortitude saves. Both benefits last until the start of your next turn.
