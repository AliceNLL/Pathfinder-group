![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Frequency** once per minute

**Requirements** You hit a creature with a melee Strike on your last action.

* * *

You channel some of your own nature through your blow, temporarily warping your target's form to resemble your own. The creature you hit must attempt a DC resolve fortitude save against the higher of your class DC or spell DC.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target resists the effect but its form twists in the process. It's [[Clumsy 1]] until the end of its next turn.

**Failure** The target's body briefly warps to resemble yours. It's clumsy 1 until the end of its next turn and [[Sickened 1]].

**Critical Failure** The target's body warps to resemble yours for a significant time. It's clumsy 1 for 1 minute and [[Sickened 1|Sickened 2]].
