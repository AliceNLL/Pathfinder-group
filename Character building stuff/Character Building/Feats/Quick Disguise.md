# Quick Disguise
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You can set up a disguise in one-tenth the usual time (generally 1 minute). If you're a master in Deception, you can create a full disguise and [[Impersonate]] as a 3-action activity. If you're legendary, it takes a single action.
