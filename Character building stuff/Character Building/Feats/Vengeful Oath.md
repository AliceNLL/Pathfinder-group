# Vengeful Oath
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You've sworn an oath to hunt down wicked evildoers and bring them to judgment. You gain the following edict: "You must hunt down and exterminate creatures that have committed heinous atrocities." You can use [[Lay on Hands]] to damage a creature you witness harming an innocent or a ally as if it were undead; in this case, lay on hands deals spirit damage instead of vitality damage and gains the holy trait. This doesn't prevent you from healing such a creature with lay on hands; you choose whether to heal or harm.
