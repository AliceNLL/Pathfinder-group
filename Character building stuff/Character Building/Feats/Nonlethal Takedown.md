# Nonlethal Takedown
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You prefer to use nonlethal means against living opponents, but the weapons you carry are lethal enough to destroy undead. You don't take the normal -2 circumstance penalty when attacking nonlethally with a weapon that lacks the nonlethal trait.
