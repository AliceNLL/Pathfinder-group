**Frequency** once per hour

**Trigger** You attempt a skill check requiring three actions or fewer.

You stimulate your nanites, forcing your body to temporarily increase its efficiency. You gain a +2 status bonus to the triggering skill check. In addition, your circuitry glows, lighting a 10 foot emanation with dim light for 1 round.
