# Natural Magnetism
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your connection with elemental iron grants you a natural field of weak magnetic attraction. You can cast _[[Magnetic Attraction]]_ and _[[Magnetic Repulsion]]_ once per day each as 2nd-rank primal innate spells.

* * *

**Special** If you chose the gildedsoul lineage, you can replace one of the above spells with _[[Enthrall]]_.
