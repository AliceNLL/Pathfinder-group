![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

When you cast grease, you can modify its target to be 1 creature. If you do, replace the spell's standard effects with the following: You splash the target with combustible grease. The target must attempt a Reflex save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target is splattered with grease and gains weakness 2 to fire until the end of your next turn. The target or an adjacent creature can rub off the combustible grease with an Interact action, ending the effect.

**Failure** As success, except the weakness to fire lasts for 1 minute.

* * *

**Heightened (+2)** The weakness increases by 1.
