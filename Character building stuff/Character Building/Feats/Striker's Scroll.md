# Striker's Scroll
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You can attach a scroll to your weapon or _[[Handwraps of Mighty Blows]]_ to blend its spell into an attack, carefully folding it around a part of the weapon or sealing it to the weapon's surface. Attaching a scroll requires using the [[Affix a Talisman]] action. You can have only one scroll affixed to a weapon at a time, and you can't have both a talisman and scroll attached.

You can Cast the Spell from the scroll as part of a Spellstrike, assuming the spell is one you could normally use with Spellstrike. You can't Cast the Spell in any other way while it's affixed, though you can use Affix a Talisman again to remove the scroll and use it as a normalâ€”if a bit crumpled-scroll.
