# Crashing Slam
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You can dash your foe to the ground with a single blow. When you use Slam Down, instead of making a Strike followed by a [[Trip]], you can attempt a single Strike. If you do and your Strike hits, instead of rolling a check for your Trip attempt, you automatically apply the critical success effect of a Trip. If you used a two-handed melee weapon for the Strike, you can use the weapon's damage die size instead of the regular die size for the damage from a critical Trip.
