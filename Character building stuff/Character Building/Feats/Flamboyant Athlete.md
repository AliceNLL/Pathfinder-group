# Flamboyant Athlete
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your Panache allows you to perform incredible feats: climbing, swimming, and leaping far beyond your normal capacity. While you have panache, you gain the following benefits.

*   You gain climb and swim Speeds equal to half your land Speed.
*   The DCs of your [[High Jump|High Jumps]] and [[Long Jump|Long Jumps]] decrease by 10. This doesn't combine with other abilities that reduce those DCs.
*   The distance you can move with a vertical [[Leap]] increases to 5 feet. Your distance for a horizontal Leap increases to 15 feet if your Speed is at least 15 feet, or to 20 feet if your Speed is at least 30 feet.
