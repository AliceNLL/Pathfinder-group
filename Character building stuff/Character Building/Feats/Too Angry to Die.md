# Too Angry to Die
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** you stand up from [[Prone]] after waking up from being [[Unconscious]]

* * *

You refuse to yield the battle, even after you've been knocked off your feet and nearly killed. For you, such a brush with death is less something to fear and more a thing to become infuriated by. As you stand up, you roar in defiance and can attempt to [[Demoralize]] a foe.
