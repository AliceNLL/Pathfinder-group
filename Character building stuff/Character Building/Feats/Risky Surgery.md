# Risky Surgery
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your surgery can bring a patient back from the brink of death, but might push them over the edge. When you [[Treat Wounds]], you can deal 1d8 slashing damage to your patient just before applying the effects of Treat Wounds.

If you do, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your Medicine check to Treat Wounds, and if you roll a success, you get a critical success instead.
