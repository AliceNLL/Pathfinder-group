# Perfect Distraction
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You use clever tactics to mislead your foes as you sneak away. You [[Sneak]] while leaving a decoy behind. The decoy acts as the spell [[Mislead]], though you aren't [[Invisible]], just undetected. You can continue to concentrate to move your decoy, as with the spell, whether or not you remain [[Hidden]] throughout the duration. Once you use Perfect Distraction, you need to spend 10 minutes to set up another decoy before you can use it again.
