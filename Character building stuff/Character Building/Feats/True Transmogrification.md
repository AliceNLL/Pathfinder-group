# True Transmogrification
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You transmogrify your eidolon each day. During your daily preparations, you can swap out any number of your evolution feats, each for a different evolution feat of an appropriate level for which you meet the prerequisites. These swaps last until your next daily preparations.
