# Wave Spiral
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Frequency** once per minute

**Requirements** You're in Reflective Ripple Stance.

* * *

You dip and spin, unleashing a wide whirlpool of water. Make an Athletics check to [[Trip]] each creature standing on the ground in a 10 foot emanation.

These attacks all count toward your multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase until after you make all the attacks.
