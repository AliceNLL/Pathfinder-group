# Tamper
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You tamper with a foe's weapon or armor, using a free hand. Choose either a weapon held by an enemy in your reach or a suit of armor worn by an enemy in your reach. Attempt a Crafting check against the enemy's Reflex DC.

* * *

**Critical Success** Your tampering is incredibly effective. If you tampered with a weapon, the enemy takes a -2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls and damage rolls with that weapon. If you tampered with armor, the armor hampers the enemy's movement, making the enemy [[Off-Guard]] and inflicting a -10-foot penalty to its Speeds. The effect lasts until the enemy Interacts to remove it, regardless of which one you used. 

**Success** Your tampering is temporarily effective. As critical success, but the effect ends at the start of your next turn, even if the enemy doesn't Interact to end it. 

**Critical Failure** Your tampering backfires dramatically, creating a small explosion from your own tools or gear. You take fire damage equal to your level.
