![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** You are wielding a melee weapon in two hands.

* * *

You attack all nearby adversaries. Make a melee Strike with the required weapon against each enemy within your melee reach. Each attack counts toward your multiple attack penalty, but don't increase your penalty until you have made all your attacks.
