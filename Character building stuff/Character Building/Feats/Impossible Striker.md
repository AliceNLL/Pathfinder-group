# Impossible Striker
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Nothing can prevent you from making a sneak attack, even if your opponent can see every blow coming. Instead of dealing the damage from [[Sly Striker]], you can deal your full sneak attack damage to a target even if the target isn't [[Off-Guard]].
