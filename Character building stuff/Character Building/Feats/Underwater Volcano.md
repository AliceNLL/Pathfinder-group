# Underwater Volcano
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You can cast _[[Volcanic Eruption]]_ as a 7th-level primal innate spell once per day, except that you can only evoke the volcano on the floor of a body of water, and the effects that normally happen to flying creatures happen to swimming creatures instead.
