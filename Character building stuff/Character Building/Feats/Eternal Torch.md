# Eternal Torch
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You open a connection to your kinetic gate, large enough for a torch flame to flow. You create a magical, torch-like flame within 120 feet in any color you choose. It's as bright and hot as a torch. You can have it orbit a target willing creature or emit from a target object that's unattended or attended by a willing creature. If you create a flame on a weapon, you still need to use it as an improvised weapon to attack with the flame, just as with a torch.

The flame has an unlimited duration. You can have a maximum number of Eternal Torches equal to your Constitution modifier, and you can Dismiss each torch individually.

**Level (8th)** All your torches—even ones you already created—shed bright light in a 60-foot radius (and dim light for the next 60 feet).
