# Black Powder Boost
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** You're wielding a loaded firearm.

* * *

You fire your weapon as you jump, using the kickback to go farther. You [[Leap]] and discharge your firearm to add a +10-foot status bonus to the distance traveled. If you spend 2 actions for Black Powder Boost, you [[High Jump]] or [[Long Jump]] instead.

**Special** An ability that allows you to High Jump or Long Jump as a single action (like the [[Quick Jump]] skill feat) lets you use Black Powder Boost as a single action for those jumps as well.
