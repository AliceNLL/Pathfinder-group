# Twinned Defense (Fighter)
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** You are wielding two melee weapons, one in each hand.

* * *

You're always ready to use your off-hand weapon to interfere with attacks against you. While you are in this stance, you constantly gain the benefits of the [[Twin Parry]] action.
