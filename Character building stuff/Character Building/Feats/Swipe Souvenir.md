# Swipe Souvenir
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** You're [[Grabbed]] or [[Restrained]] by a creature.

* * *

When you wriggle free from an enemy's grasp, you take something of theirs with you. You attempt to [[Escape]] from being grabbed or restrained by a creature. If you succeed, you can also attempt to [[Steal]] from the creature, even if the creature is in combat.
