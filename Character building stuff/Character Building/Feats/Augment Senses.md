# Augment Senses
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You open vestigial eyes, unfurl tympanic flaps of skin, or otherwise enhance your senses. Until the start of your next turn, you gain the following benefits: you can't be flanked; when you Seek for creatures, you can scan a 60 foot cone or a 30 foot burst instead of the normal area; and when you Seek for hidden objects, you can search a 15-foot square instead of the normal area.
