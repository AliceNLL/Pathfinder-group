# Wilderness Spotter
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Select one type of terrain from the following list: aquatic, arctic, desert, forest, mountain, plains, sky, swamp, or underground. You can use Survival in place of Perception to roll initiative when in the selected terrain in a natural location (not a structure) even if you weren't tracking or otherwise using Survival before the encounter. You can also use Survival instead of Perception to notice traps in natural locations in the chosen terrain; if you find a snare in this way, you can also use Survival instead of Thievery to Disable the Device.

**Special** You can select this feat more than once. Each time you select it, the feat applies to a new type of terrain.
