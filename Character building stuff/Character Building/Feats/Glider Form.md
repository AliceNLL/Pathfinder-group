# Glider Form
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your eidolon evolves wings, a buoyant body, or some other means to control descent.

It glides slowly toward the ground, 5 feet down and up to 25 feet forward through the air.

As long as it spends at least 1 action gliding each round and has not yet reached the ground, it remains in the air at the end of your turn.
