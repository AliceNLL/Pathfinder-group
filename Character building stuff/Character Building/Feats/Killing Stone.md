# Killing Stone
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your star orb hides a deadly miasma. You can cast 5th-level _[[Toxic Cloud]]_ as a divine innate spell once per day. The spell's normal components are replaced with a focus component (your star orb) and a somatic component to aim the orb towards the location for the spell.
