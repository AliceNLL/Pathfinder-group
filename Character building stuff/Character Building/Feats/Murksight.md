![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your vision pierces through non-magical fog, mist, rain, and snow. You don't take circumstance penalties to ranged attacks or Perception checks caused by non-magical precipitation, and your targeted attacks don't require a flat check to succeed against a target [[Concealed]] only by such effects.
