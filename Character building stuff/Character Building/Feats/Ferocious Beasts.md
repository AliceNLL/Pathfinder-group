![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Since ancient times, the mightiest orc beast tamers would draw out the true fighting spirit of their companion beasts by feeding the creatures a draft incorporating the orc's own blood. All animal companions, pets, familiars, and bonded animals you have gain the [[Orc Ferocity]] feat, and gain one reaction per round they can use only for Orc Ferocity. If you have the [[Undying Ferocity]] ancestry feat, all animal companions, pets, familiars, and bonded animals you have also gain the benefits of that feat when using the Orc Ferocity reaction.
