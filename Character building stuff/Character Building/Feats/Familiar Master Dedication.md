# Familiar Master Dedication
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You have forged a mystical bond with a creature. This might have involved complex rituals and invocations, such as meditating under the moon until something crept out of the forest. Or maybe you just did each other a good turn, such as rescuing the beast from a trap or a foe, and then being rescued in turn.

Whatever the details, you are now comrades until the end. You gain a familiar. If you already have a familiar, you gain the [[Enhanced Familiar]] feat.

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the [[Familiar Master]] archetype.
