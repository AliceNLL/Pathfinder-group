# Pinpoint Poisoner
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Unsuspecting targets are especially vulnerable to your poisons. When you successfully Strike an off-guard creature with a poisoned weapon or expose an [[Off-Guard]] creature to an inhaled poison, the off-guard condition also gives that creature a -2 circumstance penalty to its initial save against that poison.
