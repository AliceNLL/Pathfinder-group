# Nanite Shroud
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

Your nanites fly out of your body, swarming around you in a cloud.

You become [[Concealed]] for a number of rounds equal to half your level. You can't use this concealment to [[Hide]] or [[Sneak]], as normal for concealment that makes your position obvious.

While Nanite Shroud is active, you can't use other abilities that require the use of your nanites.
