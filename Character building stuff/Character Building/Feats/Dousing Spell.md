# Dousing Spell
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You enhance your spell with elemental water, soaking the target. If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell targeting a single creature, you soak the target of the spell with water. If the target has [[Persistent Damage|Persistent Acid or Fire Damage]], the DC to end those conditions is reduced to 10, and the creature can attempt a flat check to end those types of persistent damage immediately. The spell gains the water trait (causing it to deal extra damage to creatures with weakness to water).
