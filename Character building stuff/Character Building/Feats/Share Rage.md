![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** You haven't used this ability since you last Raged.

* * *

You stoke an ally's fury. While you are raging, one willing creature within 30 feet gains the effects of the [[Rage]] action, except it can still use concentrate actions.
