# Shifting Faces
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

You wear many faces, even those that don't belong to you. When you Change Shape into your tailless form, you gain the effects of 3rd-level _[[Illusory Disguise]]_ for 1 hour or until you shift back, except it's a transmutation effect rather than an illusion.
