# Greater Sun Blessing
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your connection to the Old Sun Gods grows stronger. You gain an advanced domain spell from a domain you chose with Blessing of the Sun Gods. Increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1.

**Special** You can select this feat multiple times. Each time you do so, you must select a different domain for which you have an initial domain spell from Blessing of the Sun Gods.
