# Elemental Fist
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You call upon the power of the elements, infusing your ki with elemental energy and allowing your attacks to deal energy damage.

When you cast _[[Ki Strike]]_, in addition to the damage types normally available, you can deliver the extra damage in the form of a gust of storm-tossed wind (dealing electricity damage and gaining the air trait), a chunk of stone (dealing bludgeoning damage and gaining the earth trait), a flickering flame (dealing fire damage), or a crashing wave of frigid water (dealing cold damage and gaining the water trait).
