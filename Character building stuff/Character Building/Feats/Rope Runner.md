# Rope Runner
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You run and climb across ropes and rigging almost as easily as on the ground. You gain a [[Climb]] Speed of 15 feet, but only on ship's rigging or similar ropes.

Whenever you succeed at an Athletics check to Climb a rope or an Acrobatics check to [[Balance]] on a rope, you get a critical success instead. You aren't [[Off-Guard]] while Climbing or Balancing on a rope.
