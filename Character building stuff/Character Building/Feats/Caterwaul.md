![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** An ally within 30 feet would be reduced to 0 HP but not immediately killed.

You give a daring yowl in the face of adversity, calling your companion back from the brink of unconsciousness.

Your ally isn't knocked out and remains at 1 Hit Point. Your ally's [[Wounded]] condition still increases by 1 as though they had been dying and recovered.
