# Deliberate Death
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** You are about to gain the dying condition as a result of another creature's attack or ability, and that creature is within your melee reach.

* * *

Once, you died because someone—murderer or monster, soldier or executioner—chose to strike you down. Just before losing consciousness, make a melee Strike against the triggering creature.

* * *

**Special** You can select this feat only at 1st level, and you can't retrain into or out of this feat.
