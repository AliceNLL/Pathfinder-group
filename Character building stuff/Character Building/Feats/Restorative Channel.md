# Restorative Channel
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You can remove conditions with divine grace. You can sacrifice one _[[Heal]]_ spell you've prepared in your extra slots from your healing font to cast one of the following spells instead: _[[Cleanse Affliction]]_, _[[Clear Mind]]_, _[[Sound Body]]_, or _[[Sure Footing]]_. The spell is heightened to the same rank as the spell you sacrificed.
