# Additional Lore
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your knowledge has expanded to encompass a new field. Choose a Lore skill subcategory. You become trained in it. At 3rd, 7th, and 15th levels, you gain an additional skill increase you can apply only to the chosen Lore subcategory.

* * *

**Special** You can select this feat more than once. Each time you must select a new subcategory of Lore and you gain the additional skill increases to that subcategory for the listed levels.
