# Watch Your Back

You menace the target, stoking their fears and drawing their attention. Attempt an intimidation check against the Will DC of a target within 30 feet. If you succeed, for 1 minute, that target gains a +2 status bonus to Perception checks against you, but it takes a â€“2 status penalty to Will saves against fear effects.
