# Incredible Luck (Halfling)
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Even other halflings consider you to be particularly lucky. You can use Halfling Luck once per hour, rather than once per day. If you have [[Guiding Luck]], you can still use Halfling Luck when you fail a Perception check or attack roll only once per day (though you can use it within the same hour that you used Halfling Luck), and if you have [[Shared Luck (Halfling)|Shared Luck]], you can still use Halfling Luck on an ally instead of yourself only once per day.
