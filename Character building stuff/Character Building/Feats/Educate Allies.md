![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** An ally benefiting from one of your composition spells is subject to an effect with the auditory, illusion, linguistic, sonic, or visual trait.

* * *

You tweak the properties of your composition spell to convey a bit of your defensive knowledge. All allies affected by your composition spell gain your +1 circumstance bonus from [[Well-Versed]] until the start of your next turn. Teaching your allies also bolsters your own skills; your personal circumstance bonus from Well-Versed also increases to +2 until the start of your next turn.
