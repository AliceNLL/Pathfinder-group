# Stumbling Stance
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You enter a seemingly unfocused stance that mimics the movements of the inebriated-bobbing, weaving, leaving false openings, and distracting your enemies from your true movements.

While in this stance, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Deception checks to [[Feint]]. The only Strikes you can make are stumbling swing unarmed attacks. These deal 1d8 bludgeoning damage; are in the brawling group; and have the agile, backstabber, finesse, nonlethal, and unarmed traits.

If an enemy hits you with a melee Strike while in this stance, it becomes [[Off-Guard]] against the next stumbling swing Strike you make against it before the end of your next turn.
