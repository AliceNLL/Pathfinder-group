# Solar Detonation
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Blinding flames explode in a swirling sphere! The detonation fills a 20-Foot Burst within 60 feet of you. Each creature in the area takes 6d6 fire + 2d6 vitality damage, and can become Dazzled or Blinded depending on the result of its DC 0 Reflex save. The light from Solar Detonation is sunlight for creatures with a particular vulnerability to sunlight. Each creature that attempts a save becomes temporarily immune to being dazzled or blinded by Solar Detonation for 10 minutes, but not the impulse's other effects.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature takes half damage and is dazzled until the start of your next turn.

**Failure** The creature takes full damage and is blinded until the start of your next turn.

**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage and is blinded for 1 minute.

* * *

**Level (+2)** Increase the fire damage by 1d6 and the vitality damage by 1d6.
