# Divine Disharmony
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

From your collection of religious trinkets, you pull out opposing divine objects-such as the religious symbols of two deities that are hated enemies-and combine them in a display that causes discordant clashes of divine energy that are especially distracting to the faithful. Roll your choice of a deception or intimidation check against the Will DC of a creature you can see within 60 feet, with the following results. If the creature is particularly devoted to a deity, such as a cleric, celestial, monitor, fiend, or other creature with divine spells, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your skill check. The GM might determine that a creature that despises all deities, such as an alghollthu, is unaffected.
