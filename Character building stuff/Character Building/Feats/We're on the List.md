# We're on the List
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** An ally you can see and hear is about to attempt a Deception check to [[Impersonate]] someone or [[Lie]].

* * *

Emulating Shensen whenever she arrives at a show, you share your knowledge of the region and drop a few important local names to make a good impression and help your allies do the same. Attempt a Society check to Aid your ally. If you succeed, you recall a few specific details about local culture and personalities to help support your ally's deception. In addition to the benefits of your Aid, the triggering ally rolls their Deception check twice and takes the better result. This is a fortune effect.
