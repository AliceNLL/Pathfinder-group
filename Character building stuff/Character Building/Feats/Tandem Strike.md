# Tandem Strike
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** A creature is in your and your eidolon's reach.

You and your eidolon each attack, seamlessly targeting the same foe without interfering with each other's movements. Your eidolon makes a melee Strike, and then you make a melee Strike against the same creature. Both attacks count toward your multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase until after both attacks have been made.
