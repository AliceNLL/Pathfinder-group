# Opportune Throw
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** You are Juggling a thrown weapon.

**Trigger** A creature within 10 feet of you uses a manipulate action or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using.

* * *

You make a thrown ranged Strike with the required weapon against the triggering creature. If you critically succeed and the trigger was a manipulate action, you disrupt that action. This Strike doesn't count against your multiple attack penalty, and your multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike.
