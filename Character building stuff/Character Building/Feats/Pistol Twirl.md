# Pistol Twirl
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** You're wielding a loaded one-handed ranged weapon.

* * *

Your quick gestures and flair for performance distract your opponent, leaving it vulnerable to your follow-up attacks. You [[Feint]] against an opponent within the required weapon's first range increment, rather than an opponent within melee reach. If you succeed, the foe is [[Off-Guard]] against your melee and ranged attacks, rather than only your melee attacks. On a critical failure, you're off-guard against the target's melee and ranged attacks, rather than only its melee attacks.
