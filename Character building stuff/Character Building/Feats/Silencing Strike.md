# Silencing Strike
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

A quick strike to the face or mouth silences your opponent. Make a melee Strike against a foe. The foe must succeed at a DC resolve fortitude save against your class DC.

* * *

**Success** The target is unaffected.

**Failure** The target is dazed and can barely vocalize. It's [[Stunned 1]] and its speech is raspy and hard to understand. It must succeed at a DC 11 flat to use linguistic actions or supply verbal spellcasting components until the end of its next turn.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature is [[Stunned 1|Stunned 3]] instead of stunned 1.
