# Barreling Charge
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You rush forward, moving enemies aside to reach your foe. You Stride, attempting to move through your enemies' spaces, and make a melee Strike. Roll an athletics check and compare the result to the Fortitude DC of each creature whose space you attempt to move through during your Stride, moving through their space on a success but ending your movement before entering their space on a failure. You can use Barreling Charge to Burrow, Climb, Fly, or Swim instead of Stride if you have the corresponding movement type.
