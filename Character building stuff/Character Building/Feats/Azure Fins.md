When submerged in water or another liquid, you form small fin-like arms along your body, granting you far greater maneuverability while swimming. You gain a swim Speed equal to your land Speed. Furthermore, while swimming on the surface of a liquid, you can [[Leap]] out of the liquid and do not fall until the end of your turn, allowing you to spend the rest of the turn above the surface.
