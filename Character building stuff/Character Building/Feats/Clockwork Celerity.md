**Trigger** Your turn begins.

* * *

You can use unstable clockwork devices in your innovation to push your invention to act more quickly. You are [[Quickened]] for this turn. How you can use the extra action depends on your innovation.

*   **Armor** You can use the extra action to Step, Stride, or use another movement action granted by your innovation (such as Swim if you have the Diving Armor feat).
*   **Construct** You can use the extra action to Command your construct innovation (or to provide 1 of the actions if you spend 2 actions to Command your construct).
*   **Weapon** You can use the extra action to Strike with your innovation or Reload your innovation.

DC 17 flat{Unstable Check}

On a failure, the innovation malfunctions in a spectacular (though harmless) fashion, such as a belch of smoke or shower of sparks, and it becomes incapable of being used for further unstable actions.

On a critical failure, you also take fire damage equal to your level.
