# Ghoran Lore
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

The very first memories ghorans have are those of their creation, and even after thousands of years, those memories have never faded for you. You become trained in Arcana and Nature. If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in Ghoran Lore.
