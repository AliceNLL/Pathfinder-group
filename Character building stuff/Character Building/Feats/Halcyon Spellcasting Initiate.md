# Halcyon Spellcasting Initiate
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your knowledge of halcyon magic increases. You gain two common 2nd-level halcyon spells and two 3rd-level halcyon spells. You also gain a 2nd-level halcyon spell slot and a 3rd-level halcyon spell slot. These and all future halcyon spell slots work like the 1st-level halcyon spell slot you gained from Halcyon Speaker Dedication.
