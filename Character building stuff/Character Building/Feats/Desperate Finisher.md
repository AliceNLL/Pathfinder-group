# Desperate Finisher
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** You complete the last action on your turn, and your turn has not ended yet.

* * *

You throw everything you have into one last, reckless press. Use a single action that you know with the press trait. You forgo the ability to use reactions until the start of your next turn. This press uses your multiple attack penalty, as normal.
