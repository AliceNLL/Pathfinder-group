# Innate Magical Intuition
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You've spent countless hours learning to recognize and predict a creature's innate magical abilities. The first time you successfully Recall Knowledge to identify a creature, in addition to any information you learn from your successful check, you learn the names of three of the highest-level innate spells it can cast, and you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on your next save against an innate spell cast by that creature.
