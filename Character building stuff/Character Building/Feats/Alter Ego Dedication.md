# Alter Ego Dedication
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You make yourself into a living mirror, becoming a double of someone unremarkable, and you slip into exactly the role that can get you past security or into a sensitive facility. You become an expert in Deception. You gain the [[Assume a Role]] activity.

* * *

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two other feats from the [[Alter Ego]] archetype.
