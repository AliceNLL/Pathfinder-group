# Magic Sense
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You have a literal sixth sense for ambient magic in your vicinity. You can sense the presence of magic auras as though you were always using a 1st-rank detect magic spell. This detects magic in your field of vision only. When you [[Seek]], you gain the benefits of a 3rd-rank [[Detect Magic]] spell on things you see (in addition to the normal benefits of Seeking). You can turn this sense off and on with a free action at the start or the end of your turn.

**Special** This feat has the trait corresponding to the tradition of spells you cast (arcane, divine, natural, or occult).
