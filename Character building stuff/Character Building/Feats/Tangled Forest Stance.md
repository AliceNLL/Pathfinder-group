# Tangled Forest Stance
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** You are unarmored

* * *

You extend your arms like gnarled branches to interfere with your foes' movements. You can make lashing branch unarmed attacks. These deal 1d8 slashing damage; are in the brawling group; and have the agile, finesse, nonlethal, and unarmed traits.

While you're in Tangled Forest Stance and can act, every enemy in your reach that tries to move away from you must succeed at a Reflex save, Acrobatics check, or Athletics check against your class DC or be [[Immobilized]] for that action. If you prefer, you can allow the enemy to move.
