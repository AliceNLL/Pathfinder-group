# Lie to Me
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You can use Deception to weave traps to trip up anyone trying to deceive you. If you can engage in conversation with someone trying to [[Lie]] to you, use your Deception DC if it is higher than your Perception DC to determine whether they succeed. This doesn't apply if you don't have a back-and-forth dialogue, such as when someone attempts to Lie during a long speech.
