# Instinctive Strike
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You trust your instincts and your sense of smell, using all of your senses to pinpoint your opponent's location.

Make a melee Strike against an opponent that isn't hiding its scent with an effect like _[[Negate Aroma]]_. This attack ignores any flat check required due to the target being [[Concealed]] or [[Hidden]].
