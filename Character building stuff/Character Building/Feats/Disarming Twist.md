# Disarming Twist
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** You are wielding a single one-handed melee weapon and hold nothing else in your hands.

* * *

After your initial attack redirects your foe's defenses, your follow-up wrests their weapon from their grasp. Make a melee Strike with a one-handed melee weapon. In addition to its other effects, this Strike gains the success and critical success effects of the [[Disarm]] action. The Strike also has the following failure effect.

**Failure** The target is [[Off-Guard]] until the end of your current turn.

* * *

**Special** If you're in [[Disarming Stance]], you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the attack roll.
