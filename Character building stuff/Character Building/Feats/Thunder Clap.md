# Thunder Clap
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You slam your hands together to unleash a deafening blast. Creatures in a 15 foot cone cone take 3d6 sonic damage, with a DC resolve fortitude against your class DC. Creatures that critically fail their save are also [[Deafened]] for 1 minute. You can't use this ability again for 1d4 rounds as your hands recover from the thunderous vibrations.

At 8th level, and every 2 levels thereafter, the damage from Thunder Clap increases by 1d6.
