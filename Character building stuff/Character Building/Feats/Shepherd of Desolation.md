# Shepherd of Desolation
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You know how to keep others alive in the Gravelands' murkiest shadows. Allies within 10 foot emanation{10 feet} of you gain the benefit of [[Survivor of Desolation]]. If you are a champion, this aura is a champion aura, even though you gained it from Knight Reclaimant instead of a champion feat or feature.
