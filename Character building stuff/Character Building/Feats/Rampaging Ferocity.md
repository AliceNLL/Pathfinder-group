# Rampaging Ferocity
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** You use [[Orc Ferocity]].

* * *

You lash out viciously even as you fend off death. Make a single melee Strike. If this Strike brings a foe to 0 Hit Points, this activation of Orc Ferocity doesn't count against its frequency.
