# Burning Spell
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You enhance your spell with elemental fire, causing it to set the target on fire. If the next action you use is to Cast a non-cantrip Spell that deals damage at a single target, the spell deals additional [[Persistent Damage|Persistent Fire Damage]] equal to the spell rank, in addition to its other effects. This has no effect if the spell already deals persistent fire damage. The spell gains the fire trait.
