# Strategic Bypass
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your plans account for your foes' resistances, enabling you to strike a telling blow. When you hit with a Strike on which you substituted your attack roll due to [[Devise a Stratagem|Devise a Strategem]], you ignore an amount of resistance equal to your Intelligence modifier for each resistance that applies against your attack.
