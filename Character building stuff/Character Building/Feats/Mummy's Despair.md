# Mummy's Despair
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Frequency** once per hour

* * *

You force your mental anguish outward, projecting it upon those around you. You gain an aura of despair in a 30 foot emanation lasting 5 rounds. A creature that enters or begins its turn in the aura must succeed at a DC resolve will save against the higher of your class DC or spell DC or be [[Frightened|Frightened 1]] ([[Frightened|Frightened 2]] on a critical failure). A creature that succeeds at the save is temporarily immune to Mummy's Despair for 10 minutes.
