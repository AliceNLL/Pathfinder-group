# Invoke The Elements (Brine May)
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

You summon an aura of crashing waves.

For 1 minute, you gain [[Concealed|Concealment]] against creatures more than 5 feet away, and any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of you suffers 1d12 bludgeoning damage (DC resolve reflex save using your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher).

At 2d12 bludgeoning{13th} and 3d12 bludgeoning{17th} level, this damage increases by 1d12.
