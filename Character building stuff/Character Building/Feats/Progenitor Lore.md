# Progenitor Lore
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You didn't just inherit your physical form from your progenitor; you also retained some of their knowledge. You're trained in Deception and Occultism. If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in a Lore corresponding to your ancestry (e. g., Elf Lore if your progenitor is an elf).
