# Edgewatch Detective Dedication
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You become trained in Society or Thievery; if you are already trained in both of these skills, you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You can use Perception instead of Survival to Track, and you gain the [[Experienced Tracker]] skill feat.

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the [[Edgewatch Detective]] archetype.
