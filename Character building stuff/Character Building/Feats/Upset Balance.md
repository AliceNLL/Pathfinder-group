# Upset Balance
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** You are damaged by a melee Strike.

**Requirements** You are in Tenacious Stance.

* * *

You lean into your foe's attack, using the weight of your body and armor to send them reeling. Attempt an athletics check against the creature's Reflex DC. On a success, the target becomes [[Clumsy 1]] until the end of its next turn ([[Clumsy 1|Clumsy 2]] on a critical success). If you are anchored, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to this check.
