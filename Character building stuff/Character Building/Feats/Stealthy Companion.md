# Stealthy Companion
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You've trained your animal companion to blend in to its surroundings. Your animal companion gains the benefit of the [[Camouflage]] feat. If your companion is a specialized ambusher, its proficiency rank for Stealth increases to master (or legendary if it was already master).
