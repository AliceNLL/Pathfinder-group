# Sticky Poison
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

A combination of additional viscosity and careful application keeps your weapons poisoned even when suffering significant wear and tear.

If your Strike with a poisoned weapon would expend its poison without your target attempting an initial save (due to resistance or your Strike being a critical failure, for example), attempt a DC 5 flat. On a success, your weapon remains poisoned.

If your Strike with a poisoned weapon succeeds, attempt a DC 17 flat. On a success, your weapon remains poisoned until the end of your next turn.
