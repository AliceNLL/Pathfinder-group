First impressions are your strong suit. When you meet someone in a casual or social situation, you can immediately attempt a Diplomacy check to [[Make an Impression]] on that creature rather than needing to converse for 1 minute. If you fail, you can engage in 1 minute of conversation and attempt a new check at the end of that time rather than accepting the failure or critical failure result.
