# Hag Claws
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

When you came of age, your fingernails grew long and sharp. You gain a claw unarmed attack that deals 1d4 slashing damage. Your claws are in the brawling group and have the agile, finesse, and unarmed traits.

**Special** Hag claws can develop at any point in a changeling's life. You can select this feat anytime you would gain an ancestry feat, but you can't retrain out of it.
