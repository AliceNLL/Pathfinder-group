# Experienced Professional

You carefully safeguard your professional endeavors to prevent disaster. When you use Lore to [[Earn Income]], if you roll a critical failure, you instead get a failure. If you're an expert in Lore, you gain twice as much income from a failed check to Earn Income, unless it was originally a critical failure.
