# Disillusionment
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Dreams are pointless illusions you seek to quash. If you roll a success on a saving throw against an illusion or dream effect or a Perception check to disbelieve an illusion, you get a critical success instead. If you roll a critical failure on any of those checks, you get a failure instead.
