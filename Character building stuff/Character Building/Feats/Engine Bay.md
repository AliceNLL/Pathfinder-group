You are practiced at working in vast garages of vehicles and can work on many machines at a time. When Repairing and spending the full 10 minutes, you can fix up to two objects. If you are a master in Crafting, you can fix up to four targets. If you're legendary in Crafting, you can fix up to eight targets. This feat has no effect when using Quick Repair or another ability to reduce the time spent Repairing.
