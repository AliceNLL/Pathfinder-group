# Debilitating Bomb
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Frequency** once per round

**Trigger** You use [[Quick Alchemy]] to craft an alchemical bomb that is at least 2 levels lower than your advanced alchemy level.

* * *

Your bombs impose additional effects on your enemies. You mix a substance into the bomb that causes one of the following: [[Dazzled]], [[Deafened]], [[Off-Guard]], or a -5-foot status penalty to Speeds.

If the attack with that bomb hits, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or suffer that effect until the start of your next turn. Use your class DC for this saving throw (even if someone else throws the bomb).
