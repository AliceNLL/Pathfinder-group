# Lobbed Attack
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** You are Juggling a thrown weapon.

* * *

You make a thrown ranged Strike with the required weapon, using the weapon's normal range increment. This attack doesn't trigger reactions, and if the target has never seen you use this feat before, the target is off-guard against this attack.
