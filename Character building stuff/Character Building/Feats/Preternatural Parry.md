# Preternatural Parry
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** You're targeted by a Strike or a spell attack roll, or you're about to roll a saving throw against a spell effect.

**Requirements** You have one or more hands free.

* * *

You snap your weapon or limb into place to ward off harm at the last second. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to AC and saving throws against the triggering effect until the start of your next turn.
