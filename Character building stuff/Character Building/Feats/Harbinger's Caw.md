# Harbinger's Caw
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** A creature within 60 feet is about to attempt an attack roll or skill check.

* * *

You caw ominously, cursing the creature with misfortune. The target creature must roll the triggering check twice and take the lower result.
