# Martial Performance
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your muse has taught you how to handle a wider variety of weapons than most bards, empowering you to effortlessly blend your performance into combat tools. When you have a courageous anthem composition cantrip active, and you damage an enemy with a Strike, the spell's duration is extended by 1 round. You can extend an individual casting only once in this way.

If you gain the rallying anthem or song of strength composition cantrips, you can apply this benefit to those cantrips as well.
