# Scorching Disarm
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

You make a weapon unbearable to hold. Attempt an Athletics check to Disarm a target creature. You don't need to have a hand free to make this Disarm attempt. If the Disarm attempt succeeds, the target takes 4d6 fire damage unless it drops the weapon, and on a critical success, it takes 4d6 fire damage and drops the weapon. If you're legendary in Athletics, this increases to 8d6 fire damage.
