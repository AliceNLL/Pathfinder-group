# Terrain Stalker
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Select one type of difficult terrain from the following list: rubble, snow, or underbrush. While undetected by all non-allies in that type of terrain, you can [[Sneak]] without attempting a Stealth check as long as you move no more than 5 feet and do not pass within 10 feet of an enemy during your movement.

During exploration, this also allows you to automatically approach within 15 feet of other creatures while [[Avoid Notice|Avoiding their Notice]], as long as they aren't actively Searching or on guard.

**Special** You can select this feat multiple times. Each time, choose a different type of terrain.
