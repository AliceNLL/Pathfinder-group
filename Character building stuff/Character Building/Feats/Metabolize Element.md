# Metabolize Element
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** You take damage from a foe's spell or magical ability with a trait of one of the elements in your elemental philosophy.

* * *

You rapidly metabolize the elemental particles in your opponent's spell to gain a boost of energy. You gain the [[Quickened]] condition until the end of your next turn. You can use the extra action only to Step or Stride.
