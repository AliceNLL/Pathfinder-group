# Finishing Precision
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You've learned how to land daring blows when you have [[Panache]].

You gain the [[Precise Strike]] class feature but you deal 1 addition damage on a hit and 1d6 damage on a finisher. This damage doesn't increase as you gain levels. In addition, you gain the [[Basic Finisher]] action.
