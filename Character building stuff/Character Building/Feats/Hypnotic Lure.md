# Hypnotic Lure
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Frequency** once per hour

* * *

Your unblinking gaze is so intense it can befuddle the mind of others, drawing your victims toward you even against their better judgment. You stare at a creature within 30 feet. The target must attempt a DC resolve will save against the higher of your class DC or spell DC.

**Success** The target is unaffected.

**Failure** On its turn, the target must spend its first action to approach you. It can't Delay or take reactions until it has done so.

**Critical Failure** The target must use all its actions on its next turn to approach you. It can't Delay or take any reactions until it has reached a space that's adjacent to you (or as close to you as possible if it reaches an impassable barrier).
