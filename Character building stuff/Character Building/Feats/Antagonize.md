# Antagonize
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your taunts and threats earn your foes ire. When you successfully [[Demoralize]] a creature, its [[Frightened]] condition can't decrease to less than 1 at the end of its turn until it either uses a hostile action against you or can no longer observe or sense you for at least 1 round.
