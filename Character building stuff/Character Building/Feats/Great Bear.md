# Great Bear
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Frequency** once per hour

* * *

When you transform, you can take on a bear's bulk and size. You can spend an additional action when using Ursine Avenger Form to gain the effects of a 1st-level _[[Enlarge]]_ spell, which lasts for the spell's normal duration or until you leave your Ursine Avenger Form, whichever comes first.
