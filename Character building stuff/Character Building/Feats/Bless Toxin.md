# Bless Toxin
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You pour void energy into toxins you create to further debilitate your targets. When you [[Craft]] an alchemical poison (rather than create it with advanced alchemy, Quick Alchemy, or another means), it becomes a blessed alchemical poison and gains the void trait. When a creature is afflicted with a blessed alchemical poison, for 1 round, any Hit Points it would regain from a vitality effect are reduced by 5, or by 10 if you are legendary in Crafting.
