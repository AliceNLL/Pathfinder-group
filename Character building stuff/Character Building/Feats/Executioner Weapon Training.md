# Executioner Weapon Training
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your Gray Gardener training has made you deeply skilled with the weapons that execute with a swift chop to the neck. You become trained with the following weapons: [[Battle Axe]], [[Falchion]], [[Greataxe]], and [[Scimitar]].

Whenever you gain a class feature that grants you expert or greater proficiency with a given weapon or weapons, you also gain that proficiency for these weapons.
