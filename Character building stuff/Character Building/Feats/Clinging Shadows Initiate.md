# Clinging Shadows Initiate
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You learn a mystical stance that transforms your ki into sticky smoke that shrouds your limbs, clinging to everything you touch.

You gain the _[[Clinging Shadows Stance]]_ ki spell. Increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1. While entering the stance uses a ki spell, the shadow grasp attacks it grants are not, so you can use them as often as you like while in the stance.
