# Buckler Dance
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** You are wielding a [[Buckler]].

* * *

You spin your buckler defensively toward every attack. While you are in this stance, you constantly have your buckler raised as if you'd used [[Raise a Shield]], as long as you meet that action's requirements.
