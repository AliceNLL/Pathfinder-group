# Agile Hand
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

When you cast mage hand, you can modify its target to be a set of thieves' tools. When you Cast the Spell in this way, the tools move up to 20 feet towards a device or lock. After you Sustain the Spell on future turns, you can use the tools to attempt Thievery checks to Disable a Device or Pick a Lock within the spell's range, but you take a -2 penalty to your Thievery check. If you critically fail, the spell ends and you can't use this modification again for 24 hours.
