# Surging Might
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

With a complex gesture, you focus the divine power of your spell to overcome enemies' resistances. If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell, the spell ignores an amount of the target's resistance equal to your level against all the following types of damage: chaotic, evil, good, lawful, negative, and positive.

This applies to all damage the spell deals, including persistent damage and damage caused by an ongoing effect of the spell, such as the vitality energy within a _[[Field of Life]]_. This doesn't cause the spell to ignore immunities, only resistances.
