# Lunging Spellstrike
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** You're wielding a staff.

* * *

Your spell unwinds the structure of your staff to make it exceptionally long, or even separate it into shards held together by magical power.

Make a Spellstrike with a staff, with a spell that isn't a cantrip or focus spell. Increase the staff's reach by 5 feet Ã— the spell's level.
