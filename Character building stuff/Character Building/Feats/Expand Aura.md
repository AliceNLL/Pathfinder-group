# Expand Aura
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You focus your divine power to extend your influence. Select one aura you have from a champion feat or feature, such as [[Aura of Courage]] or [[Aura of Life]]. The radius of the aura is doubled until the start of your next turn.
