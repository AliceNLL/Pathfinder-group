# Remember Your Training
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

During your training to become a Pathfinder Agent you were schooled on a wide variety of creatures you might encounter, and you can think back to that training to gain crucial insight in times of need. Attempt a check to Recall Knowledge about a creature you can see, adding your level as a proficiency bonus if you are untrained (rather than 0). If you roll a failure (but not a critical failure) on this check, you get a success instead.
