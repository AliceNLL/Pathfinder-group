# Psi Catastrophe
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You stop holding your power back, unleashing it all in a catastrophic blast. All creatures in a 20 foot emanation take 1d6 bludgeoning damage per level with a DC resolve reflex. Your psyche subsides as your power is expended.
