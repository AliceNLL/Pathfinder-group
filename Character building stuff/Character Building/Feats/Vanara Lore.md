# Vanara Lore
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You attained the cultural training of a ba-sadhak, a seeker of treasures and rare delights. You become trained in Survival and Thievery. If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You're also trained in the Vanara Lore skill.
