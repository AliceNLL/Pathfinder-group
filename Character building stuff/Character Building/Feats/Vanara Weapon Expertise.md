![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Thanks to numerous joyous practice exercises, you've become an expert in vanara weapons. Whenever you gain a class feature that grants you expert or greater proficiency in a given weapon or weapons, you also gain that proficiency in the bo staff, chakram, katar, panabas, urumi, and all vanara weapons in which you're trained.
