# Perfect Resistance
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You gain resistance equal to half your level to all damage from effects with the appropriate trait for your School of Perfection: fire for Unblinking Flame, water for Unbreaking Waves, air for Unfolding Wind, and earth for Untwisting Iron. After using a Student of Perfection ki spell, the resistance increases to be equal to your level for 1 round.
