# Dark Persona's Presence
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** You Unleash your Psyche.

* * *

When you Unleash your Psyche, all your rage and pain-the portion of your psyche dedicated to cruel retribution-come along with it.

The force of your dark persona's negativity batters constantly against all creatures in a 30 foot emanation when you Unleash your Psyche and for as long as your Psyche is Unleashed. A creature must attempt a DC resolve will save against your spell DC the first time it enters the emanation, or if it's in the emanation when you take this action; it doesn't need to attempt a save again, even if it leaves the emanation and returns. A creature frightened by your Dark Persona's Presence can't decrease its frightened value below 1 while within the emanation.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The target is [[Frightened|Frightened 1]].

**Failure** The target is [[Frightened|Frightened 2]].

**Critical Failure** The target is [[Frightened|Frightened 3]].

While your Psyche is Unleashed, your dark persona cares only for destruction. You can [[Cast a Spell]] only if it can directly damage an enemy or object or can impose a detrimental condition or penalty on one.
