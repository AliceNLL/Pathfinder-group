# Summon Nephilim Kin
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You have a connection to the celestial realms, allowing you to summon a celestial ally. Once per day, you can cast _[[Summon Celestial]]_ as a 5th-level divine innate spell, but the celestial summoned must be from the same category as your own lineage, such as a creature with the angel trait if you are angelkin.
