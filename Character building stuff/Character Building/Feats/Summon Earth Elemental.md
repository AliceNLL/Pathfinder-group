# Summon Earth Elemental
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You have a connection to the Inner Sphere, allowing you to summon an elemental ally. Once per day, you can cast _[[Summon Elemental]]_ as a 5th-level primal innate spell, but the elemental summoned must be an earth elemental.
