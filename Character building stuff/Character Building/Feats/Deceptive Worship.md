# Deceptive Worship
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Members of your cult frequently pass themselves off as worshippers of other religions. You can use Occultism instead of Deception to [[Impersonate]] a typical worshipper of another faith or to [[Lie]] specifically to claim you are a member of the faith you are Impersonating. You still need to use the Deception skill to Impersonate a specific worshipper or to perform other deceptive actions, such as attempting to Lie about any other matter.
