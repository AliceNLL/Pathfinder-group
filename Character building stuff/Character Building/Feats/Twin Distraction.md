# Twin Distraction
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** You are wielding two melee weapons, each in a different hand.

* * *

Your movements with two weapons are so swift and disorienting that they befuddle your opponent. When using [[Twin Feint]], if both your Strikes deal damage to a targeted creature, the target must succeed at a will saving throw against your class DC or become [[Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] until the end of your next turn.
