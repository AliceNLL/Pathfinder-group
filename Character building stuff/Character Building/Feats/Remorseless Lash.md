# Remorseless Lash
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You're skilled at beating a foe when their morale is already breaking. When you succeed at a melee weapon Strike against a [[Frightened]] foe, that foe can't reduce their frightened condition below 1 until the beginning of your next turn.
