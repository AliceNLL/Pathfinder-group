# Ten Lives
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

When your character would die, you can attempt a DC 17 flat check. On a success, you're instead reduced to 0 HP and a [[Dying]] value 1 less than would normally kill you (typically dying 3). This doesn't change the result for any other creature affected.
