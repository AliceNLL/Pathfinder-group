# Contortionist
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You can squeeze out of tight situations surprisingly quickly, gaining an advantage against foes that try to pin you down. You gain the [[Quick Squeeze]] skill feat, and if you're a master in Acrobatics, you can [[Squeeze]] at full Speed.

Whenever you successfully [[Escape]] using Acrobatics, the creature you Escaped from is [[Off-Guard]] against the next attack you make against it before the end of your next turn.
