# Staff Acrobat Dedication
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

When you [[High Jump]], [[Leap]], or [[Long Jump]] while wielding your staff, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to any Athletics check required and add 5 feet to the distance you can Leap vertically and horizontally. You can [[Shove]] and [[Trip]] even if you don't have a free hand, provided you are wielding your staff. Finally, when you roll a success on a check to [[Balance]] while wielding your staff, you get a critical success instead.

**Special** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the [[Staff Acrobat]] archetype.
