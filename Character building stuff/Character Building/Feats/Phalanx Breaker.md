# Phalanx Breaker
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** You're wielding a two-handed firearm or a two-handed crossbow.

* * *

You know that to take out an enemy formation, you must punch a hole through its center. Make a ranged Strike with the required weapon against a target within the weapon's first range increment. The target is pushed directly back 10 feet (20 feet on a critical hit), and if this pushes the target into an obstacle, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to half your level.
