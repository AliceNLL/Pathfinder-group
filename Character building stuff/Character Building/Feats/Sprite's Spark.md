# Sprite's Spark
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You can fling a portion of your magic at foes. You gain a ranged unarmed attack in the sling weapon group with a maximum range of 20 feet that deals `dice: 1d4` damage. (No ability modifier is added to the damage roll.) The damage type and name of the unarmed attack depends on your heritage, described below; most sprite heritages not presented in this book also use luminous spark. Like other unarmed attacks, you can improve this attack with [[Handwraps of Mighty Blows]].
