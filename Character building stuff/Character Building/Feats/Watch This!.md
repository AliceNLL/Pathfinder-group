# Watch This!
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** An ally misses or critically misses an enemy you can see with their attack.

* * *

A common saying among Firebrands is, "There's always a fool who thinks they can do it betterâ€”and they're often right." You verbally commit to using an action on your next turn to make a melee Strike against the same enemy your ally has missed. If your attack hits, you deal additional damage equal to twice the number of damage dice.
