Your craftsmanship at decorating flesh is unparalleled. You become legendary in Crafting. Whenever you craft a magical tattoo whose level is at least 3 lower than your level, increase all attack roll and DC values of the tattoo's activated abilities by 1, and increase all resistances granted by the tattoo by 1.
