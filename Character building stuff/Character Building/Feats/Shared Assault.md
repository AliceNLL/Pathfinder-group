# Shared Assault
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

In the triumph of battle, you can share the glory with another ally. When the ally you chose for [[Courageous Onslaught]] critically succeeds at the Strike granted by that action, another ally affected by your courageous anthem composition spell can immediately use a reaction to make a melee Strike. This effect doesn't continue to a third ally, even if the second ally also critically succeeds.
