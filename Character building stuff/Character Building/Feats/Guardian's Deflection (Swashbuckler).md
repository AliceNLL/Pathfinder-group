# Guardian's Deflection (Swashbuckler)
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** An ally within your melee reach is hit by an attack, you can see the attacker, and a +2 circumstance bonus to AC would turn the critical hit into a hit or the hit into a miss.

**Requirements** You are wielding a single one-handed melee weapon and have your other hand or hands free.

* * *

You use your weapon to deflect the attack against your ally, granting a +2 circumstance bonus to their AC against the triggering attack. This turns the triggering critical hit into a hit, or the triggering hit into a miss.
