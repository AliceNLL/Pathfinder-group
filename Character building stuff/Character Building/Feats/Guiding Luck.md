# Guiding Luck
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your luck guides you to look the right way and aim your blows unerringly. You can use Halfling Luck twice per day: once in response to its normal trigger, and once when you fail a Perception check or attack roll instead of the normal trigger.
