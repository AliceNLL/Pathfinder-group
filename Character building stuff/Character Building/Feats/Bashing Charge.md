# Bashing Charge
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You smash, bust, and charge through solid obstacles without hesitation. Stride twice.

Once during your movement, if your movement passes through or ends adjacent to a door, window, fence, wall, or similar obstacle, you can attempt an Athletics check to [[Force Open]] the obstacle with a +1 circumstance bonus to the roll; on a failure, your movement ends at that obstacle.
