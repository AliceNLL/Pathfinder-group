# Gift of the Hoard
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

In pleasing the cravings of a mighty dragon, they have deigned to impart some of their magical essence into your body. Your eyes begin to glow and change color while your limbs and neck grow a veneer of scales, all the same color as the associated dragon, accompanied by a near-insatiable desire to amass a hoard of your own. You gain the _[[Dragon Breath]]_ sorcerer bloodline spell, emulating the breath of the associated dragon, and a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. If you already have a focus pool, increase your number of Focus Points by 1. You Refocus by counting and arranging your treasure.
