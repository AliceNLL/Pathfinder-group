# Delay Trap
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** A trap within your reach is triggered.

* * *

You try to jam the workings of a trap to delay its effects. Attempt a Thievery check to [[Disable a Device]] on the trap with the following results instead of the normal ones for the action.

* * *

**Critical Success** You either prevent the trap from being triggered or delay the activation until the start or end of your next turn.

**Success** As above, but the GM chooses whichever is worse for you.

**Failure** No effect.

**Critical Failure** You're [[Off-Guard]] until the start of your next turn.
