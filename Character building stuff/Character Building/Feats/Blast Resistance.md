# Blast Resistance
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Access** You are from Dongun Hold or Alkenstar.

* * *

You're used to the clamor of steel, the crack of a firearm, and the thunderous blast of explosions. You gain resistance 3 to sonic. If you roll a success on a saving throw against an auditory effect that causes the [[Deafened]] condition, you get a critical success instead.
