# Whirlwind Strike
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You lash out in a blur of motion, attacking all nearby adversaries. Make a melee Strike against each enemy within your melee reach. Each attack counts toward your multiple attack penalty, but you do not increase your penalty until you have made all your attacks.
