# Bat Form
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Frequency** once per hour

* * *

You can transform into a bat. You gain the effects of a 4th-level _[[Pest Form]]_ spell. At 14th level, you can choose to spend two actions instead of one to gain the effects of a 4th- or 5th-level _[[Aerial Form]]_ spell instead (bat form only).
