# Mask Of Power
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your _warmask_ sharpens your connection to the source of your mask's power. During your daily preparations, choose _[[Fear]]_, _[[Phantom Pain]]_, or _[[Sure Strike]]_.

Until your next daily preparations, you can cast this spell as a 1st-level innate spell once per day; the spell's tradition is determined by the tradition tied to your _warmask_. You must be wearing your _warmask_ to Cast the Spell.
