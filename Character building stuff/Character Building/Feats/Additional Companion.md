# Additional Companion
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Another animal joins you in your travels. It is a young animal companion that has the minion trait. See Beastmaster Animal Companions (in Beastmaster Dedication) for rules on how having multiple animal companions works.

**Special** You can select this feat more than once, gaining an additional animal companion each time, to a maximum of four total companions (including the one you gained from Beastmaster Dedication and possibly one you gained from sources other than the beastmaster archetype).
