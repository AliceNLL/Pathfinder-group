You lift your enemy into the air before bringing them crashing down with a fiery detonation. Roll an athletics check against your target's Fortitude DC. You take a -1 circumstance penalty to your check if the target is one size larger than you and a -3 circumstance penalty if it's larger than that. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your check if the target is one size smaller than you and a +3 circumstance bonus if it's smaller than that.

**Success** As critical success, but the target takes 6d6 fire damage instead of 12d6, and creatures don't take persistent fire damage.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but you fall prone.
