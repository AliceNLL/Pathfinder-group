# Sense Allies
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Like many humans raised in a close-knit community, you have always been strongly attuned to the presence of others. Willing allies that you are aware of within 60 feet that would otherwise be undetected by you are instead [[Hidden]] from you. The flat check for you to target willing allies within 60 feet that are hidden from you is DC 5 flat instead of 11.
