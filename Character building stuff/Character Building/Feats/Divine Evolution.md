# Divine Evolution
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

The divine might provided by your bloodline flows through you. You gain an additional spell slot of your highest level, which you can use only to cast your choice of _[[Heal]]_ or _[[Harm]]_. You can cast either of these spells using that spell slot, even if they aren't in your spell repertoire.
