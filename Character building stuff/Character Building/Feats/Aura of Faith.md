# Aura of Faith
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You radiate an aura of pure belief that imbues your attacks and those of nearby allies with holy power. Your Strikes deal and extra 1 spirit damage against unholy creatures. Also, each willing ally within 15 feet gains this benefit on their first Strike that hits an unholy creature each round.
