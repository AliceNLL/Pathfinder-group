# Brightness Seeker
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Once per day, you can spend 10 minutes studying your surroundings in search of omens related to a particular course of action to cast _[[Augury]]_ as an innate divine spell. Unless the result of the _augury_ was "nothing," you gain the [[Call Upon the Brightness]] reaction for the next 30 minutes.
