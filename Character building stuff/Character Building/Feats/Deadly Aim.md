# Deadly Aim
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You aim for your prey's weak spots, making your shot more challenging but dealing more damage if you hit. Make a ranged Strike against your hunted prey at a â€“2 penalty. You gain a +4 circumstance bonus to damage on that Strike. This bonus increases to +6 at 11th level and +8 at 15th level.
