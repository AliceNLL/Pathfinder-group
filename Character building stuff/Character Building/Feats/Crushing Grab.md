# Crushing Grab
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Like a powerful constrictor, you crush targets in your unyielding grasp. When you successfully [[Grapple]] a creature, you can deal bludgeoning damage to that creature equal to your Strength modifier. You can make this attack nonlethal with no penalty.
