# Predictable!
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

By observing an opponent, you can get a sense of their next move and prepare to counter or resist it. Choose one target and attempt a Perception check to [[Sense Motive]] against the foe's Deception DC or a hard DC of the foe's level, whichever is higher.

* * *

**Critical Success** You precisely discern the target's strategy, gaining a +2 circumstance bonus to AC against the creature until the start of your next turn and a +2 circumstance bonus to your next saving throw against the creature before the start of your next turn.

**Success** You deduce the gist of the target's strategy; as critical success, except the circumstance bonus is only +1.

**Failure** You fail to discern the target's strategy and gain no benefit.

**Critical Failure** You misinterpret the target's strategy and take a –1 circumstance penalty to AC against the creature until the start of your next turn, and a –1 circumstance penalty to your next saving throw against the creature before the start of your next turn.
