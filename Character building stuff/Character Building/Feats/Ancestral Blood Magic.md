# Ancestral Blood Magic
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

The magic of your bloodline mixes with that of your ancestry. You gain your blood magic effect when you cast a non-cantrip spell you gained from a heritage or an ancestry feat, in addition to the normal circumstances that trigger your blood magic.
