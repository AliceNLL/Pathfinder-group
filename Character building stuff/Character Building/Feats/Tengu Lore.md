![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You learned skills for surviving in the place where your people were dispersed. You gain the trained proficiency rank in Society and Survival. If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in Tengu Lore.
