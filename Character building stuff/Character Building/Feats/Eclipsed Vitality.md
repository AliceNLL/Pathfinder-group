# Eclipsed Vitality
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You shroud yourself in ashes that hide the vital essence sought by life-sensing undead. You're always taking precautions when [[Avoid Notice|Avoiding Notice]], [[Hide|Hiding]], and [[Sneak|Sneaking]] to foil lifesense, and you're [[Concealed]] to any creature using only precise lifesense to observe you.
