# Superior Sight (Darkvision)
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your senses are peerless. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks, and you gain low-light vision. If you already have low-light vision, gain darkvision instead.

Furthermore, when you target an enemy, you automatically succeed at the flat check if that enemy is [[Concealed]], [[Hidden]], or [[Undetected]].

_Note: this version of the feat grants darkvision automatically._
