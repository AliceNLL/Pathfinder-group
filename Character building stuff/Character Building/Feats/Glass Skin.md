# Glass Skin
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Prerequisites** You were present at the death of the medusa Alethsia, whose vitrumantic powers were passed on to you in the wake of her destruction.

* * *

Even if vitrumancy is a mystery to you, your blood and flesh know the secrets of the art of arcane glass. Patches of your skin to flicker into glass without warning. By focusing the effect, you can concentrate the glass into a powerful protective layer of magical obsidian. Once per day, you can cast _[[Mountain Resilience]]_ on yourself as an innate primal spell, though the spell covers you in a layer of glass instead of stone. During this innate _mountain resilience_, you gain the [[Shatter Glass]] reaction. At 18th level, the _mountain resilience_ is heightened to 6th level instead of 4th.
