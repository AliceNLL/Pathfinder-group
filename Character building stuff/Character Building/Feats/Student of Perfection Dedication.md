# Student of Perfection Dedication
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Access** You are from Jalmeray.

* * *

You have learned the martial arts techniques of your House of Perfection. You become trained in your choice of Acrobatics or Athletics and Warfare Lore; if you were already trained, you become an expert instead. You gain the [[Ki Strike]] monk class feat, which grants you the ki strike ki spell and a focus pool of 1 Focus Point that you can recover using the Refocus activity as a monk does. Your ki spells from Student of Perfection are occult spells.

* * *

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the [[Student of Perfection]] archetype.
