# True Shapeshifter
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You transcend the limitations of form. Once per day you can cast [[Nature Incarnate]], even if you don't have it prepared, to transform into a kaiju. If you have [[Plant Shape]], you can choose to transform into a green man instead. You also gain the [[True Shapeshift]] activity.
