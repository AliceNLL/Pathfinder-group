# Impossible Flurry
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** You are wielding two melee weapons, each in a different hand.

* * *

You forgo precision to attack at an impossible speed. Make three melee Strikes with each of the required weapons. Your first attack with each weapon takes the multiple attack penalty as though you had already made one attack this turn. All of the remaining Strikes take the maximum multiple attack penalty.
