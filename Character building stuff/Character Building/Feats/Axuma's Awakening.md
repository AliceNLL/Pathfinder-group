# Axuma's Awakening
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Choose two cantrips from the arcane spells list. You can cast these cantrips at will as arcane innate spells. A cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up. Then, choose one 1st-level spell and one 2nd-level spell from the arcane spells list. You can cast each of these spells once per day as arcane innate spells. Spells gained from this feat must be common spells or spells to which you have access.
