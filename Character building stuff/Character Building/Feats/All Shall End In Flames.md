# All Shall End In Flames
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

White-hot fire consumes everything in a cataclysmic sphere of death. The fire fills your choice of a 30 foot burst within 500 feet or a 30 foot emanation. This deals 13d6 fire damage with a DC resolve reflex save against your class DC. Any creature dropped to 0 HP by this fire dies, reduced to a pile of ash.

If you die to this impulse, you return to life at the start of your next turn in the same space. When you return, you have Hit Points equal to double your level.

* * *

**Level (20th)** The damage is 15d6 fire.
