# Lie Detector
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You're adept at noticing the tells of a liar - sweat, flushing, a quavering voice, a quickening pulse.

You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Perception checks to [[Sense Motive]] and to Perception DCs against attempts to [[Lie]] to you.

When you determine someone is lying to you, you can use their deceit to your advantage to gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the next Deception, Diplomacy, Intimidation, or Performance check you attempt against that creature within the next minute.
