# Terrain Scout
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You gain the [[Terrain Stalker]] skill feat twice, choosing a different terrain each time.

If you [[Avoid Notice]] while exploring and any allies use [[Follow the Expert]] to follow you as you do so, you can choose one of those allies to gain the benefit of any one Terrain Stalker feat you have.
