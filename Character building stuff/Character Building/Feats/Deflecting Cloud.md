# Deflecting Cloud
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Frequency** once every 10 minutes

**Trigger** You are the target of a ranged attack.

**Requirements** You are aware of the attack and currently have dragon wings active.

* * *

You've mastered a defensive technique unique to the ancient dragons of Bloodsalt: beating your wings to create a billowing cloud of mist. You become momentarily [[Hidden]] from the triggering attack if vision is the attacker's only precise sense. Normally this means the attacker must succeed at a DC 11 flat check to target you. You also gain a +4 circumstance bonus to AC against the triggering attack.
