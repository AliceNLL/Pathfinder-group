# Inertial Barrier
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your spell leaves behind barriers that reduce shock and motion. Use this amp in place of a psi cantrip's normal amp entry.

* * *

**Amp** You or one target of the spell gains resistance to physical damage equal to 2 + the spell's level until the start of your next turn.
