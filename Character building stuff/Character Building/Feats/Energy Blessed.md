![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Energy runs through your blood more powerfully. When you use Energy Emanation, you can create an emanation of 5 feet, 10 feet, or 15 feet. The damage increases to 6d6 plus an additional 1d6 for every level you have above 9th, instead of 1d6 plus an additional 1d6 for every 2 levels above 1st.
