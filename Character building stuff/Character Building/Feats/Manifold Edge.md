# Manifold Edge
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You've learned to leverage every possible edge. When you use [[Hunt Prey]], you can gain a different hunter's edge benefit instead of the one you selected at 1st level. If you do, you don't gain the additional benefit from [[Masterful Hunter]].
