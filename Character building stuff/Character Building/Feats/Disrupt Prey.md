# Disrupt Prey
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** Your hunted prey is within your reach, and it uses a manipulate action, uses a move action, or leaves a square during a move action it's using.

* * *

Make a melee Strike against your prey. If the attack is a critical hit, you disrupt the triggering action.
