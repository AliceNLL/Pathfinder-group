# Ricocheting Leap
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You quickly use your momentum to topple and spring off of foes. You can use [[Wall Jump]] to make additional jumps off of creatures larger than you as if they were walls. Once per turn when you make an additional jump off of a creature in this way, you can also attempt to [[Shove]] or [[Trip]] that creature as a free action.
