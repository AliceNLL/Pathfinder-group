# Holy Light
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You raise your arms to the sky and pray fervently, surrounding yourself in a beacon of holy light. The beacon sheds bright light in a 30 foot burst{30-foot-radius, 100-foot-high cylinder} centered on you until the beginning of your next turn. Evil creatures in the area must succeed at a DC resolve will save equal to your class DC or spell DC (whichever is higher) or become [[Dazzled]] for 1 round.
