# Night Magic
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You can tap into the magic that runs through your blood. You gain _[[Animal Form]]_ (wolf only, using the statistics for a canine) and _[[Mist]]_ as 2nd-level divine innate spells. You can cast each of these spells once per day.
