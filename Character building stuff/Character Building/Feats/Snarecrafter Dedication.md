# Snarecrafter Dedication
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You've learned to create a limited number of snares at no cost. Each day during your daily preparations, you can prepare four snares from your formula book for quick deployment; if they normally take 1 minute to [[Craft]], you can Craft them with 3 [[Interact]] actions. The number of snares increases to six if you're a master in Crafting and eight if you're legendary.

Snares prepared in this way don't cost you any resources to Craft.

**Special** The feat counts as [[Snare Specialist]] for the purpose of feat prerequisites. If you also have the Snare Specialist ranger feat, the [[Quick Snares]] from both feats are cumulative. You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the [[Snarecrafter]] archetype.
