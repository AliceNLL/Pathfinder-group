# Spell Runes
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

The magical runes on your body grant you several magical abilities. Choose a 1st-level arcane spell. You gain a spell rune on your body corresponding to the chosen spell, which you can cast once per day as an innate spell. At 6th level, you gain a spell rune corresponding to a 2nd-level arcane spell, and at 8th level, you gain a spell rune corresponding to a 3rd-level arcane spell.
