# Venom Spit
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You've learned the art of lobbing toxic spittle at vulnerable spots on your foes, especially the eyes. You gain a venomous spit ranged unarmed attack with a range increment of 10 feet that deals 1d4 poison damage. On a critical hit, the target takes persistent poison damage equal to the number of weapon damage dice. Your spit doesn't have a weapon group, nor a critical specialization effect.

**Special** If you have the hooded nagaji heritage, in addition to your venomous spit's normal critical hit effect, the target is also [[Dazzled]] until the start of your next turn.
