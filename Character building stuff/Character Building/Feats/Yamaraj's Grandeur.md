# Yamaraj's Grandeur
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

You have been granted a sliver of the power of the yamaraj, the magistrates of the dead who agreed to allow duskwalkers to exist at all. You exhale a blast of icy wind and ravenous insects. This is a 30 foot cone that deals 14d6 slashing damage and 4d6 persistent,slashing damage (DC resolve reflex save using your class or spell DC, whichever is higher). On a critical failure, targets also become [[Sickened 1|Sickened 2]].
