# Bless Tonic
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You channel vitality energy into restoratives that ward against harm. When you [[Craft]] an alchemical item that restores Hit Points (rather than create it with advanced alchemy, Quick Alchemy, or another means), it becomes a blessed alchemical item and gains the vitality trait. For example, an [[Elixir of Life (Minor)|Elixir of Life]] would become a blessed elixir of life. When a creature regains Hit Points using a blessed alchemical item, the overflowing energy grants them void resistance 5 for 1 round, or void resistance 10 if you are legendary in Crafting.
