# Intimidating Prowess
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

In situations where you can physically menace the target when you [[Coerce]] or [[Demoralize]], you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your Intimidation check and you ignore the penalty for not sharing a language. If your Strength modifier is +5 or higher and you are a master in Intimidation, this bonus increases to +2.
