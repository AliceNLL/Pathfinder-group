# Sun's Fury
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

The Old Sun Gods have granted you a gift in your fight against Walkena. You gain the _[[Sun's Fury]]_ focus spell. If you don't already have one, you gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point, which you can regain using the Refocus activity to pray to the Old Sun Gods; if you already have a focus pool, increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1. Your Bright Lion focus spells are divine spells; when you gain this feat, if you aren't already, you become trained in divine spell attacks and spell DCs, using Charisma as your spellcasting ability score.
