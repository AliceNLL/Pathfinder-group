**Requirements** You are wielding a loaded ranged weapon with reload 1 or more, and you have not reloaded your weapon since your last turn.

After watching the motions of combat with incredible intensity and precision, you fire at your prey at the perfect moment to deliver maximum pain. Make a ranged Strike with the required weapon against your hunted prey. If you hit, the Strike deals maximum damage. After the Strike, your turn ends.
