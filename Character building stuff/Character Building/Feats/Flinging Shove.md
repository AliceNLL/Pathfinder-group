# Flinging Shove
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Whether you're shoving opponents with a shield or a large weapon, you've learned to push them even further. Increase the distance you [[Shove]] your opponent with [[Aggressive Block]] or [[Brutish Shove]] to 10 feet on a success or 20 feet on a critical success. When you use Aggressive Block, you can choose whether the target is [[Off-Guard]] or Shoved. When you make a Brutish Shove, you also Shove the target 5 feet on a failure.
