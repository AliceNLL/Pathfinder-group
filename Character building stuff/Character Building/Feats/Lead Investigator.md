# Lead Investigator
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You spend 1 minute briefing up to four allies about one lead you're pursuing.

Those allies gain the same circumstance bonus you do from [[Pursue a Lead]] to checks to investigate that lead. This bonus lasts until you cease pursing that lead or for 1 day, whichever comes first. This doesn't confer any other benefits of pursuing a lead, such as adding the circumstance bonus to your saves with [[Detective's Readiness]].
