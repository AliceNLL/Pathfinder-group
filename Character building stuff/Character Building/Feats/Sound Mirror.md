# Sound Mirror
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You twist not just the visual, but the auditory as well, allowing you to pass without a sound and create minor noises as distractions-perfect for misdirection and infiltration. You can cast _[[Silence]]_ on yourself as a 2nd-level innate occult spell and _[[Ventriloquism]]_ as a 1st-level innate occult spell, both once per day. You also can cast _[[Ghost Sound]]_ as an innate occult cantrip. You become trained in occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs, and your key spellcasting ability is Charisma.
