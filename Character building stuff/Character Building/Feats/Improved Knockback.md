# Improved Knockback
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

When you successfully [[Shove]] a creature, increase both the distance you can push the creature and the distance you can move to follow along with the target by 5 feet on a success or 10 feet on a critical success.

If you push the target into an obstacle, it takes bludgeoning damage equal to 6 plus your Strength modifier, or 8 plus your Strength modifier if you have legendary proficiency in Athletics.
