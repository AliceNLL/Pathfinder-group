# Prayer Attack
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** You are wielding a [[Sawtooth Saber]] in each hand.

* * *

You've mastered the signature assassination style of the Red Mantis. Attempt to [[Feint]] an enemy within 30 feet. If your Feint is successful, when you use Prayer Attack on subsequent turns you automatically make the target off-guard against your melee attacks for that turn without rolling a check to Feint, so as long as you remain visible to the target and the target remains within 30 feet of you. If you use your Prayer Attack against a different target, you must attempt to Feint the target normally.

When you use Prayer Attack, your next successful Strike with a sawtooth saber that turn deals 2d6 bleed to the target.
