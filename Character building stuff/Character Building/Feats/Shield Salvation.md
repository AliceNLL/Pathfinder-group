# Shield Salvation
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You can save your shield from total destruction, even after a devastating attack. If a shield would be destroyed due to damage taken during your [[Shield Block]], the shield remains intact at 1 Hit Point instead.

Its construction is weakened until you take the time to repair it, preventing you from using Shield Salvation to save the same shield until your next preparations.
