![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** Your reanimated clockwork companion is reduced to 0 Hit Points.

**Requirements** You're within 60 feet of your reanimated clockwork companion.

* * *

You've installed a self-destruct device within your construct companion, which you can trigger with a special device from up to 60 feet away. When you activate the device, your reanimated construct companion explodes, dealing 2d6 fire damage per level to all creatures in a 30 foot emanation{30-foot radius}. Creatures caught in the blast can attempt a DC resolve reflex save, with a DC equal to the higher of your class DC or spell DC.
