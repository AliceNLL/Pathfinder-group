# Smoke Curtain
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** You're wielding a loaded firearm and are wearing or holding a dose of black powder.

* * *

You load an extra dose of powder into your shot, causing it to belch a cloud of smoke. You make a Strike with your firearm and create a cloud of smoke in a 20 foot emanation centered on your location. Creatures are [[Concealed]] while within the smoke, and creatures outside the area are concealed to creatures within the smoke. The smoke dissipates at the start of your next turn. If your Strike is a critical failure, your firearm misfires.
