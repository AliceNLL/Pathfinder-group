# Enervating Wail
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You release a terrible wail that tears at the spirits of all nearby. All living creatures in a 20 foot emanation take void damage with a DC resolve fortitude save. The damage is 4d6, plus 1d6 for every level you have beyond 6th.

* * *

**Awakening** Your scream echoes in the mind. You can choose to emit a silent psychic wail instead, which changes the damage type to mental, changes the save to a DC resolve will save, removes the auditory trait, and adds the mental trait.

* * *

**Awakening** Your wail saps your foes' strength. In addition to the normal effects, living creatures in the area are [[Enfeebled 1]] for 1 round on a success (but not a critical success), enfeebled 1 for 1 minute on a failure, and [[Enfeebled 1|Enfeebled 2]] for 1 minute on a critical failure.
