# Safe House
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You establish a safe house-a secure space in which to hide your secrets from the outside world.

This safe house is roughly the size of a 10-foot cube. It's in a location you have access to, and it can be part of a larger building or structure, like a hidden room or an underground cave.

The safe house protects objects and people inside it from magical detection. This has the effects of _[[Veil of Privacy]]_, using your Deception modifier for the counteract DC and half your level rounded up for the counteract level.

Setting up or moving your safe house takes a week of downtime.

The size of the safe house expands to four 10-foot cubes if you're an expert in Deception, eight cubes if you're a master, and 16 cubes if you're legendary.
