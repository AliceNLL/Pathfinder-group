# Siphon Life
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Experiences with necromantic energy have left a permanent mark on you, casting you in a deathlike pallor, chilling your body temperature to be ice-cold, turning your very blood black, and giving you the power to rip out an enemy's life force. Strike with an unarmed attack. If you hit and the target is a living creature, it takes 4d6 void damage, depending on its Fortitude save. If the target takes any void damage, you gain an equal number of temporary Hit Points, which last for 1 minute.

* * *

**Critical Success** The enemy takes no additional void damage and becomes temporarily immune for 1 minute.

**Success** The enemy takes half the additional void damage.

**Failure** The enemy takes full additional void damage.

**Critical Failure** The enemy takes double the additional void damage.
