# Mage Hunter
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** A creature within your reach [[Cast a Spell]].

* * *

You use your hatred of magic to lash out at the sight of spellcasting, allowing you to interrupt an enemy's spell. Make a melee Strike against the triggering creature. If the attack is a critical hit, you disrupt the spell.
