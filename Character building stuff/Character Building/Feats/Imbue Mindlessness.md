# Imbue Mindlessness
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You grasp the mind of an undead creature and temporarily wipe it as empty as a zombie's brain. You can target any undead with your divine innate _[[Harm]]_ spell, not just mindless undead. When you target one non-mindless undead creature with this spell, you can transform its effects. Instead of harm's normal effects, the target must attempt a Will save.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

**Success** The target is [[Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] for 1 round.

**Failure** The target is [[Stupefied|Stupefied 2]] for 1 minute. While it is stupefied, you can use your Corpse Tender feats on the target as though it were mindless.

**Critical Failure** As failure, except the target is [[Stupefied|Stupefied 3]] for 10 minutes.
