# Ratfolk Growth
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You call upon the familial bonds you share with other ysoki to defend them in battle. You can cast _[[Enlarge]]_ as a 6th-level primal innate spell once per day. You can target only yourself and other ratfolk with this spell.
