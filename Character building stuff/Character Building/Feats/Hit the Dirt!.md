# Hit the Dirt!
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** A creature you can see attempts a ranged Strike against you.

* * *

You fling yourself out of harm's way. You [[Leap]]. Your movement gives you a +2 circumstance bonus to AC against the triggering attack. Regardless of whether or not the triggering attack hits, you land [[Prone]] after completing your Leap.
