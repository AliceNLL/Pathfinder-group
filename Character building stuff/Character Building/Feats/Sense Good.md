# Sense Good
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

The presence of goodness sickens you with its saccharine self-righteousness. You detect holy creatures as a vague sense, similar to humans' sense of smell. A holy creature using a disguise or otherwise trying to hide its presence attempts a Deception check against your Perception DC to hide its holiness from you. If the creature succeeds at its Deception check, it is then temporarily immune to your Sense Good for 1 day.
