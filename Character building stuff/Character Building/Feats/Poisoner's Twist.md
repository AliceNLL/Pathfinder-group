**Requirements** Your last action was a successful melee Strike that dealt damage against a target that is afflicted by a poison, and you know which poison.

Poisons attack specific parts of the body-one venom might target the lungs, another the circulatory system, while another deteriorates the nerves. You know how to take advantage of such weaknesses.

You deal 2d6 damage of each type.
