# Resounding Cascade
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** You use Arcane Cascade.

* * *

When you enter your Arcane Cascade, you disperse the magical reinforcement to nearby allies. You grant the extra damage of Arcane Cascade in an aura affecting all allies in a 5 foot emanation. This uses only the base damage of the stance, based on the ally's weapon specialization; it doesn't use any increase you get from bonuses, the laughing shadow hybrid study, or the like.

As normal for duplicate effects, multiple Arcane Cascades affecting the same creature aren't cumulative.
