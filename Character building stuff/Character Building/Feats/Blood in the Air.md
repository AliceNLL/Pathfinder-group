# Blood in the Air
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** An enemy you've damaged with a ranged weapon during the last minute is [[Concealed]] or [[Hidden]] from you.

* * *

Once you've locked on to a target, little can obscure your aim. Make a ranged weapon Strike against the required target. This Strike ignores the target's [[Concealed]] condition and reduces the flat check for the [[Hidden]] condition from 11 to 5.
