# Catch the Details
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You are quick at recognizing broad details about people and things around you. You are trained in Society and gain the [[Eye For Numbers]] skill feat. If you would automatically become trained in Society (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice.

_Note: If you are already trained in the skill provided by this feat, you need to manually select an alternative skill._
