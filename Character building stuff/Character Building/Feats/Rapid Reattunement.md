# Rapid Reattunement
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You spend 10 minutes realigning your elemental connections in an elemental trance. Replace one of your impulse feats using the same process as reflow elements. If you have double reflow, you can replace two impulse feats instead of one.
