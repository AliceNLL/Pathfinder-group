# Spell Shroud
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your spell shrouds you in a billowing cloud. If your next action is to [[Cast a Spell]] that targets you, you surround yourself in a 15 foot emanation of dense magical mist that lasts until the start of your next turn.

All creatures within the cloud become [[Concealed]], and all creatures outside the cloud are concealed to creatures within it.
