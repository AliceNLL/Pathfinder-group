# Educated Assessment
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You attempt to Recall Knowledge about a creature, and the GM uses the same secret roll result against the creature's Deception or Stealth DC, giving you the information from a Battle Assessment. You might get a different degree of success on the Recall Knowledge check than what you get for the Battle Assessment. If you have the Battle Assessment feat, you gain the effects of Educated Assessment whenever you Recall Knowledge (such as with the Automatic Knowledge feat).
