# Confabulator
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Even when caught in falsehoods, you pile lie upon lie. Reduce the circumstance bonus a target gains for your previous attempts to [[Create a Diversion]] or Lie to it from +4 to +2. If you're a master in Deception, reduce the bonus to +1, and if you're legendary, your targets don't get these bonuses at all.
