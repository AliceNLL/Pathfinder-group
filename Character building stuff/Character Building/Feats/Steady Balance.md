# Steady Balance
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You can keep your balance easily, even in adverse conditions. Whenever you roll a success using the [[Balance]] action, you get a critical success instead. You're not [[Off-Guard]] while attempting to Balance on narrow surfaces and uneven ground. Thanks to your incredible balance, you can attempt an Acrobatics check instead of a Reflex save to [[Grab an Edge]].
