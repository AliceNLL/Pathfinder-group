# Cycle Spell
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your devotion to the cycle of souls grants you an additional divine spell. Choose from _[[Bless]]_, _[[Infuse Vitality]]_, or _[[Heal]]_. You must make this selection when you take this feat and it can't be changed. Once per day, while your spiral is glowing, you can cast the selected spell as a divine innate spell.
