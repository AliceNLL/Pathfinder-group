# Irriseni Ice-Witch
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You can trace your direct descent from one of the Queens of Irrisen and thus from Baba Yaga herself. Your resistance to cold increases to 5 + half your level, and you can cast 5th-level _[[Wall of Ice]]_ as an innate arcane spell once per day.
