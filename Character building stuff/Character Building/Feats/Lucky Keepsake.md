# Lucky Keepsake
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You have a [[Lucky Keepsake|Keepsake]] that grants you luck. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saves against spells and magical effects at all times, not just when you use [[Leshy Superstition]]. If you lose the keepsake, you lose the bonus until you designate a new keepsake, typically over the course of a week.
