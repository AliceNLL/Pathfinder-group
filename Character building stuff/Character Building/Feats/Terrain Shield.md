# Terrain Shield
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Frequency** once per 10 minutes

**Trigger** A Strike would damage you.

**Requirements** You gained a terrain attunement benefit since the start of your most recent turn and that attunement matches the terrain you're in.

* * *

You're so attuned to the land that it rises up to protect you from a potentially fatal blow in a seeming coincidence. For instance, a branch suddenly falls from a nearby tree to take the brunt of a sword swing or a surprising change of current disrupts an enemy's attack. You gain resistance to physical damage equal to double your level against the triggering Strike.
