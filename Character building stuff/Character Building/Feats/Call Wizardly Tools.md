![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You're mystically connected to your wizardly tools, ensuring you can always find them when you've misplaced them. You teleport your bonded item or spellbook to you. It arrives in your hand if you have a free hand or at your feet if you don't. The item must be within 1 mile and have 1 Bulk or less.
