# Spellmaster's Tenacity
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** You critically fail at a saving throw against a foe's spell, and that spell was cast or created with the tradition of magic you selected with the [[Spellmaster's Resilience]] feat.

* * *

You call upon the power of your spells to protect you from the worst of the magic headed your way. You fail your saving throw instead of critically failing. For 1 minute, increase the circumstance bonus to saving throws from the Spellmaster's Resilience feat to +2, and increase the resistance to damage it grants to 10.
