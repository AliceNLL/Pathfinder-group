# Sanctify Water
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You imbue water with your deity's blessing. Choose a container of water on your person that is of light Bulk. For 1 round, if you or an ally throw this container at a foe, it has the damaging effects of [[Holy Water]] (if you follow a good deity) or [[Unholy Water]] (if you follow an evil deity). The water's transient power doesn't make it gain any value, allow it to be used to supply the cost for a spell or ritual, and so on. If you have legendary proficiency in Religion, you can sanctify three containers held by you or allies within your reach instead of one.
