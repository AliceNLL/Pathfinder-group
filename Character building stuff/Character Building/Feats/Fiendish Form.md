# Fiendish Form
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your features reshape into those of a type of fiend who serves your deity; for example, as a demon you might have putrid scales, twisted horns, and red eyes.

You gain a fly Speed equal to your Speed. You gain [[Darkvision]] if you don't already have it, and you gain the fiend trait and the trait appropriate to the type of servitor you've become (such as daemon, demon, or devil).
