# Purifying Spell
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You purify the water within a creature's body to cleanse them of illness. If the next action you use is to cast _[[Heal]]_ targeting a single living creature, you can attempt to counteract a disease or poison affecting the target, in addition to the other benefits of _heal_. If you do, _heal_ gains the water trait.
