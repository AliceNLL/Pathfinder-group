![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Gain the conflux spell from a hybrid study of your choice. If you don't already have one, you gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point, which you can Refocus by studying your spellbook and performing a physical regimen. You don't gain any of the hybrid study's other benefits.
