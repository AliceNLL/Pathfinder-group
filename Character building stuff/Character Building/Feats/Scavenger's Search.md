# Scavenger's Search
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You're always on the lookout for supplies and valuables. Each time you use the [[Seek]] action to search for objects (including secret doors and hazards), you can search for objects in your choice of a 10 foot emanation around you or an adjacent 15-foot-by-15-foot area, rather than a single adjacent 10-foot-by-10-foot area.
