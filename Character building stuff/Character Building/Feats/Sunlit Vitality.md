# Sunlit Vitality

You gain nourishment through photosynthesis, like trees and other green plants. You typically don't need to pay for food, though you begin to starve if you go without sunlight for 1 week. You can derive nourishment from specially formulated bottles of sunlight instead of natural sunlight, but these bottles cost 10 times as much as standard rations (4 gp per week).
