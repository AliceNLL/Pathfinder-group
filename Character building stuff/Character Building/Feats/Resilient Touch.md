# Resilient Touch
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your healing energies create an aura of protection that defends your allies against more than just blades and arrows.

An ally that recovers Hit Points from your _[[Lay on Hands]]_ gains a +1 status bonus to their saving throws until the end of their next turn.
