# Spirit's Absolution
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Cost** 1 spirit wisp or spirit remnant from your spirit dwelling

**Requirements** You are holding your spirit dwelling.

* * *

You purify a spirit by absolving it of its sins and regrets. This cathartic experience restores your Hit Points or those of an adjacent ally. If you expend a spirit wisp, the target recovers 1d4 Hit Points per level you have. If you expend a spirit remnant, the target recovers 1d6 Hit Points per level of the incorporeal undead or haunt from which you gained the remnant.
