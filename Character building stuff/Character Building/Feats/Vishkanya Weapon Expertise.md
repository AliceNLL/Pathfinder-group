# Vishkanya Weapon Expertise
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Extensive training has granted you an elegant control in the use of vishkanyan weapons. Whenever you gain a class feature that grants you expert or greater proficiency in a given weapon or weapons, you also gain that proficiency in the blowgun, fighting fan, kris, kukri, shuriken, and all vishkanyan weapons in which you are trained.
