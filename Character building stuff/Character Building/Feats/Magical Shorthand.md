# Magical Shorthand
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Learning spells comes easily to you. When you succeed at Learning a Spell, it takes 10 minutes regardless of the spell's rank. If you would succeed on the check, you critically succeed instead. If you fail, you can try again after a week or after you gain a level, whichever is first.

You can use downtime to learn and inscribe new spells. This works as if you were using [[Earn Income]] with the tradition's associated skill, but instead of gaining money, you choose a spell available to you to learn and gain a discount on learning it, learning it for free if your earned income equals or exceeds its cost.
