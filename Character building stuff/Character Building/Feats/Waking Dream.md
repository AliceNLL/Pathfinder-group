# Waking Dream
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

While in your trance, you can blur the line between dreams and reality for others. You gain the _[[Waking Dream]]_ focus spell, which you can use only while you're in a Daydream Trance. You gain a pool of Focus Points with 1 Focus Point and you can Refocus by taking a nap for 10 minutes. You become trained in occult spell attack rolls and spell DCs, and your spellcasting ability for these spells is Wisdom.
