# Keep Up Appearances
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Access** Taldan nationality

**Trigger** You are affected by an emotion effect.

* * *

Taldan pride means you never show weakness. Roll a deception  check and compare the result to any observing creatures' Perception DCs. On a success, that creature believes you were unaffected by the emotion effect.

A creature tricked in this manner can't benefit from the emotion effect and can't use abilities that require you to be under this emotion effect; for example, if you successfully use this ability to trick a will-o'-wisp into believing you aren't under a fear effect, it can't use its Feed on Fear ability on you.
