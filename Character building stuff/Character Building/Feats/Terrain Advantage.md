# Terrain Advantage
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You can take advantage of the terrain to bypass foes' defenses. Non-lizardfolk creatures in difficult terrain are [[Off-Guard]] to you. If you have a swim Speed, non-lizardfolk creatures that are in water and lack a swim Speed are also off-guard to you.
