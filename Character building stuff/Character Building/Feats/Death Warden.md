# Death Warden
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

With your intimate familiarity with the duality of vitality and void energy, you're able to stand as a bulwark against death and undeath alike. You gain resistance to void damage equal to half your level and a +1 status bonus to saving throws against effects with the void trait.
