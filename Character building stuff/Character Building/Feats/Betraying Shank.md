# Betraying Shank
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** You are within melee reach of a target, but it is not in combat with you.

* * *

While your usual diplomacy is well intentioned, you know that sometimes those same skills will need to be turned to deception. In a flash, you draw a sheathed or concealed agile or finesse weapon and make a melee Strike. The target is [[Off-Guard]] against your Strike. You then roll Deception for initiative.
