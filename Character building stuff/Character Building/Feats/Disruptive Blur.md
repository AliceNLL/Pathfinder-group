# Disruptive Blur
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You use cacophonous blasts from your gun or distracting shots from your crossbow to cause momentary diversions, letting you move about the battlefield with impunity. After you make a Strike with a firearm or crossbow, creatures can't take reactions that would be triggered by your movement for the rest of your turn.
