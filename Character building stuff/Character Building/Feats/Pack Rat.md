# Pack Rat
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Years of packing for travel have taught you how to cram vast quantities into small spaces. You can fit an additional 50% of the listed Bulk capacity into mundane storage containers or vehicles.

For example, you can fit 6 Bulk in a backpack, or 12 Bulk in a chest. This doesn't alter the items' Bulk, nor does it change how much you can store in a magical or extradimensional storage space, such as a [[Spacious Pouch (Type I)|Bag of Holding]].
