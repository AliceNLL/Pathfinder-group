# Undead Slayer Dedication
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your training has prepared you to recognize most undead on sight. You become trained in two Lore skills, each about a specific type of undead, or become an expert if you were already trained. You gain the [[Slayer's Identification]] free action.

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the [[Undead Slayer]] archetype.
