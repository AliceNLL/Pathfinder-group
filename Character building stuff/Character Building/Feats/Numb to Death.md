# Numb to Death
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

Your past has left you numb to death's call. The first time each day that you regain Hit Points while you are [[Dying]], you regain additional Hit Points equal to your level, and you neither gain the [[Wounded]] condition nor increase the value of this condition.
