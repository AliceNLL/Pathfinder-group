# Legs of Stone
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You gain a +2 status bonus to your Fortitude and Reflex DCs against attempts to [[Shove]] or [[Trip]] you. You can Shove creatures even if you don't have a hand free. When you successfully Shove a foe, you can Stride away from your opponent (instead of toward it), but you must move the same distance in the opposite direction from where you Shoved it.
