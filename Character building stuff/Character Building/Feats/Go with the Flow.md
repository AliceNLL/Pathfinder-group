# Go with the Flow
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** A creature detects your attempt to [[Impersonate]], and you're within 30 feet of at least one other creature.

* * *

You have an occult connection to the world that helps you blend in with the cacophony of life around you. Attempt an occultism check against the creature's Perception DC. On a success, the creature mistakenly identifies another creature within 30 feet of you as you instead.
