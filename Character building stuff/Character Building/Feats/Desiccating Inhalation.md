# Desiccating Inhalation
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Frequency** once per hour

* * *

You draw in the moisture from nearby creatures, draining them dry to heal your wounds. Creatures in a 30 foot cone take 6d8 void damage, with a DC resolve reflex{HP equal to your level}.

At 14th level and every 2 levels thereafter, the damage increases by 1d8.
