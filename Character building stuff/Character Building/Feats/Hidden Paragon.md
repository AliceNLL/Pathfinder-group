# Hidden Paragon
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Frequency** once per hour

**Trigger** You successfully use Stealth to [[Hide]] and become [[Hidden]] from all of your current foes, or use Stealth to [[Sneak]] and become [[Undetected]] to all your current foes.

* * *

When you slip out of sight, you disappear. You become [[Invisible]] for 1 minute, even if you use a hostile action. Not even [[Revealing Light]], [[See the Unseen]], or similar effects can reveal you, though creatures can still use the [[Seek]] action to locate you as normal.
