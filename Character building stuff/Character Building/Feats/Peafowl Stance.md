# Peafowl Stance
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** You are wielding a sword that has the monk trait in one hand.

* * *

You enter a tall and proud stance while remaining mobile, with all the grace and composure of a peafowl.

While in this stance, the only Strikes you can make are melee Strikes with the required sword. Once per round, after you hit with a monk sword Strike, you can Step as a free action as your next action.
