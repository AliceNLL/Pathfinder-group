# Assured Identification
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You rarely misidentify an item. When using Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion checks to Identify Magic, if you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead. If you would misidentify a cursed item because you roll a success but not a critical success, you simply can't identify it instead.
