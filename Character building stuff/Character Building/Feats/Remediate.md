**Frequency** once per hour

If your next action is to use your divine font to cast a 3-action [[Heal]] or [[Harm]] spell, you can harness the residual energy to counterbalance opposing forces. In addition to its normal effects, you use your _heal_ or _harm_ spell to attempt to counteract one divine effect in the spell's area.
