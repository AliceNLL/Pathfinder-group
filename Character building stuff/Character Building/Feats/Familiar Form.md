![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You can use your magic to transform into a small creature of a type that commonly serves as a spellcaster's familiar, potentially allowing you to safely scout for your party while retaining a degree of spellcasting ability. You gain the _[[Familiar Form]]_ focus spell. Increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1.
