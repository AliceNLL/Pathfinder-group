# Selective Energy
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

As you call down divine power, you can prevent some enemies from benefiting or some allies from being hurt. When you cast a version of [[Harm]] or [[Heal]] that has an area, you can designate up to 5 creatures in the area. They are not targeted by the spell.
