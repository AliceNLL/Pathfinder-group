# Wave the Flag
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You wave your banner, inspiring allies to throw off the shackles of fear. Each ally presently benefiting from your Cavalier's Banner feat reduces their current frightened condition by 1 and can choose to immediately attempt a new saving throw against any one mental effect currently affecting them. Regardless of the result, any ally that attempts a save is temporarily immune to Wave the Flag for 10 minutes.
