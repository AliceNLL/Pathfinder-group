# Sinister Appearance
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You possess horns, a tail, or red eyes, or could otherwise be mistaken for a tiefling. You gain the trained proficiency rank in Intimidation. If you would automatically become trained in Intimidation (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You gain the [[Intimidating Glare]] skill feat, as well as a +2 circumstance bonus on Deception checks to [[Impersonate]] when pretending to be a version of yourself who is a tiefling.
