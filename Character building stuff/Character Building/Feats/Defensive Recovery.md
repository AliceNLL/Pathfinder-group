![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your faith provides temporary protection in addition to healing. If the next action you use is to cast [[Harm]] or [[Heal]] on a single target and the target regains Hit Points from the spell, it also gains a +2 status bonus to AC and saving throws for 1 round.
