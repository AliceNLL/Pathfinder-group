# Mauler Dedication
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You specialize in weapons that require two hands. You become trained in all simple and martial melee weapons that require two hands to wield or have the two-hand trait.

Whenever you gain a class feature that grants you expert or greater proficiency in weapons, you also gain that proficiency rank in these weapons. If you are at least an expert in such a weapon, you gain access to the critical specialization effect with that weapon.

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the [[Mauler]] archetype.
