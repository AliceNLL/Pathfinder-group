# Emergency Medical Assistance

**Requirements** An adjacent ally is suffering persistent damage.

* * *

You've learned a variety of methods for helping allies who are bleeding, burning, or otherwise suffering persistent damage, from brushing off acid to patting down fires. Your ally immediately attempts a flat check to remove all types of persistent damage, and your use of this feat automatically counts as especially effective aid, reducing the DC from 15 to 10 for all future flat checks to remove the persistent damage.
