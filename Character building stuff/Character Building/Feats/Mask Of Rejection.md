# Mask Of Rejection
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** You fail a saving throw against an effect from your _warmask_'s magical tradition.

**Requirements** You're wearing your _warmask_.

* * *

Your _warmask_ projects a white-hot fury that attempts to vaporize the offending magic. You reroll the triggering check with a +2 circumstance bonus, but you must use the new result, even if it's worse than your first roll.
