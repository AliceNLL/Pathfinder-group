**Requirements** You are in [[Rain of Embers Stance]].

You rush forward and latch onto your enemy with talons of hungering fire.

Stride once. If you end your movement within reach of at least one enemy, you can make a fire talon Strike against that enemy that deals an additional 1d4 persistent,fire damage. If it hits and deals damage, you can attempt an Athletics check to [[Grapple]] the creature you hit.
