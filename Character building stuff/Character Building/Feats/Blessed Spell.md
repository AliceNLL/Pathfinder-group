# Blessed Spell
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Frequency** once per 10 minutes

* * *

When you focus your magic on an ally, you can remove harmful conditions.

If your next action is to [[Cast a Spell]] from a spell slot, and that spell targets only a single ally, you can also attempt to remove a harmful condition from that ally. The condition must be one that could be removed by your Mercy feat, including those granted by later feats such as [[Greater Mercy]].

Attempt a counteract check based on the spell's DC and level. This effect is in addition to the normal effects of your spell.
