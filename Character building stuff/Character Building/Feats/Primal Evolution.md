# Primal Evolution
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You can call upon the creatures of the wild for aid. You gain an additional spell slot of your highest level, which you can use only to cast _[[Summon Animal]]_ or _[[Summon Plant or Fungus]]_. You can cast either of these spells using that spell slot, even if it they aren't in your spell repertoire.
