# Flinging Charge
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You throw a weapon to distract your opponent as you close the gap to begin your assault. You Stride twice; at any point during this movement, you can make a ranged Strike with a thrown weapon. If the Strike hits, the target is [[Off-Guard]] against the next melee attack that you attempt against it before the end of your current turn.
