# Know Oneself
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Frequency** once per day

**Access** Vudrani ethnicity

**Trigger** You roll a critical failure on a saving throw against an emotion effect.

* * *

You center yourself and call to mind the Vudrani monastic ideals of mindfulness and self-knowledge. You fail the save against the emotion effect instead of critically failing.
