# Shield of Grace
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You protect an ally with both your shield and your body. Whenever you use the Shield Block reaction to prevent damage to an ally, you can evenly split the remaining damage after the Shield Block between the ally and yourself.
