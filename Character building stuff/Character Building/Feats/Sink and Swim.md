# Sink and Swim
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your body looks like it's made of flowing water, clear and pristine, providing a natural grace to all your movements. You gain a swim Speed equal to your land Speed. If you already had a swim Speed, it's increased by 10 feet. You gain the [[Water Transfer]] activity, which enables you to teleport through a body of water.
