# Powerful Shove
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You can push larger foes around with your attack. You can use [[Aggressive Block]] or [[Brutish Shove]] against a creature up to two sizes larger than you.

When a creature you Shove or knock back with a shield, polearm, or club's critical specialization effect has to stop moving because it would hit an object, it takes damage equal to your Strength modifier (minimum 1).
