# Pact of Infernal Prowess
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You've sworn a pact with devils, granting you success in life in exchange for your soul in the afterlife. Once per hour, when you critically fail a check, you can reroll the check as a free action; this is a fortune effect. Additionally, you can choose to automatically succeed at checks to [[Earn Income]] for tasks below your level, without rolling. However, when you die, your soul is consigned to Hell. You can't be returned to life except by powerful magic such as _[[Miracle]]_, and even then, the devils responsible for the contract can track your every move for 1 year. The devils gain the effects of a _[[Pinpoint]]_ spell. They can also use 10th-level _[[Scrying]]_ on you at will, and you automatically critically fail your saving throw.

**Special** You can't retrain out of a Pact of Infernal Prowess without journeying to Hell and destroying the devil's written contract spelling out the terms of your pact.
