# Snap Out Of It! (Pathfinder Agent)
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Pathfinders are trained to help each other be safe and successful, and you know how to jolt your allies back to their senses. Attempt a Medicine check on an adjacent ally who is fascinated, frightened, stunned, or stupefied and choose one of those conditions. The DC is the DC for the effect that caused the condition.

* * *

**Critical Success** Reduce the value of the chosen condition by 2. If you chose fascinated, that condition ends.

**Success** Reduce the value of the chosen condition by 1. If you chose fascinated, that condition ends.

**Failure** The target is unaffected.

**Critical Failure** You increase the value of the chosen condition by 1. If you chose fascinated, increase the duration by 1 round instead.
