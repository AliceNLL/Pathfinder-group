# Didactic Strike
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

When you find a glaring weakness, you can set your allies up to annihilate your foe.

When you use [[Shared Stratagem]], you can designate up to 10 allies instead of just one. The foe is [[Off-Guard]] against the first attack from each designated ally before your next turn, and each ally's first attack deals an extra 2d6 precision damage to the target if it hits.
