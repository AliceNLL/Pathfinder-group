# Core Rejuvenation
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** You have the dying condition and are about to attempt a recovery check.

* * *

Your soul taps into your core's power to push against the grasp of death and allow you to recover consciousness. You're restored to 1 Hit Point, lose the dying and [[Unconscious]] conditions, and can act normally on this turn. You gain or increase the wounded condition as normal when losing the dying condition in this way.

**Enhancement** Your soul can draw even more power from your core, granting you additional benefits. When you use Core Rejuvenation, you also gain a number of temporary Hit Points equal to three times your level. These Hit Points remain for 1 minute.
