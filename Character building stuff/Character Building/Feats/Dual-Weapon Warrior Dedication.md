# Dual-Weapon Warrior Dedication
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You're exceptional in your use of two weapons. You gain the [[Double Slice]] fighter feat. This serves as Double Slice for the purpose of meeting prerequisites.

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you gain two other feats from the [[Dual-Weapon Warrior]] archetype.
