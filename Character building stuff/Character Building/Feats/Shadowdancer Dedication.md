# Shadowdancer Dedication
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You dedicate yourself to the shadows. Your coloring becomes gray and gloomy, your senses adjust to the darkness, and you can sneak through darkness with ease.

You gain greater darkvision. You also gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Stealth checks when you are within dim light or darkness.

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the [[Shadowdancer]] archetype.
