# Seeker of Truths
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your devotion to discovering and hoarding abstruse truths borders on the fanatical, and you can bring this devotion to bear. You gain the cleric's [[Domain Initiate]] feat but must select knowledge, secrecy, or truth as your domain. You cast that domain's domain spell as a focus spell of the same tradition as your cantrip from Eldritch Researcher Dedication, and you Refocus by contemplating abstruse mysteries rather than praying to a god. When an ability would manifest a divine symbol—such as the _[[Word of Truth]]_ focus spell—it instead manifests as a strange shape unique to you that seems to defy geometry.

**Special** You can take this feat up to three times, selecting a different domain each time.
