# Furnace Form
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Opening your kinetic gate, you allow flames to consume your form and leave you a living flame. You gain the benefits of the _[[Fiery Body]]_ spell (except the ability to cast ignition) until the end of your next turn. You can Sustain the impulse up to 1 minute, and when you do, you can Fly up to half your fly Speed. Your fire Elemental Blasts deal an additional die of damage.

* * *

**Level (16th)** This duration is 1 minute, you can't Sustain the impulse, and you can Dismiss the impulse.
