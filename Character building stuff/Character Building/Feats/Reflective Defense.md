# Reflective Defense
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Frequency** once per 10 minutes

**Trigger** A creature within 30 feet of you targets you, and you can see the attacker.

**Requirements** You are in dim or bright light.

* * *

Your body's natural luster has been polished to a gleaming shine. You use this to reflect light back into your enemy's eyes, disrupting its aim and focus; it must succeed at a Reflex save against your class DC or be [[Dazzled]] until the end of your next turn.
