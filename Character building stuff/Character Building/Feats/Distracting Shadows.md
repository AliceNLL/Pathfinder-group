# Distracting Shadows
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You have learned to remain hidden by using larger folk as a distraction to avoid drawing attention to yourself. You can use creatures that are at least one size larger than you (usually Medium or larger) as cover for the [[Hide]] and [[Sneak]] actions, though you still can't use such creatures as cover for other uses, such as the [[Take Cover]] action.
