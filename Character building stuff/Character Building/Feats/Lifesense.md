# Lifesense
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You have a limited ability to sense life force, like your psychopomp forebears.

You gain lifesense as an imprecise sense with a range of 10 feet. This allows you to sense the life force within living creatures and its counterforce that animates the undead, though you can't distinguish between the two.
