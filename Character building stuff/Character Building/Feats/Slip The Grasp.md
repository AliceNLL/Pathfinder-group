# Slip The Grasp
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** You are [[Grabbed]], [[Immobilized]], or [[Restrained]].

* * *

You have some feature that allows you to quickly evade effects that restrain you. Attempt a check to Escape. If you succeed, you can Stride, Step, or make a Strike with a melee unarmed attack targeting the creature you Escaped from. If you fail, you instead attempt to Escape a second time.

You increase your multiple attack penalty as appropriate for the actions you took, but only after completing both actions.
