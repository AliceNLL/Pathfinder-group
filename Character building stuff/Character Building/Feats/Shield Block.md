# Shield Block
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** While you have your shield raised, you would take physical damage (bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing) from an attack.

* * *

You snap your shield in place to ward off a blow. Your shield prevents you from taking an amount of damage up to the shield's Hardness. You and the shield each take any remaining damage, possibly breaking or destroying the shield.
