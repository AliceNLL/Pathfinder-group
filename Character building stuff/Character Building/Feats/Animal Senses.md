# Animal Senses
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You gain one of the following senses available to your inherent animal: [[Darkvision]], [[Low-Light Vision]], or scent (imprecise) 30 feet. You must have low-light vision before you can gain darkvision with this feat. If your inherent animal doesn't typically have a specific type of sense, you can't gain that sense with this feat.

**Special** You can select this feat multiple times, choosing a different sense each time.
