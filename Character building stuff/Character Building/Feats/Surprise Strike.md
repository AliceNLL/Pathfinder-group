# Surprise Strike
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Whenever you make a Strike with an improvised weapon against a creature that hasn't seen you make a Strike using an improvised weapon or that is otherwise ignorant of your skill with improvised weapons, the creature is [[Off-Guard]] against you for that Strike.
