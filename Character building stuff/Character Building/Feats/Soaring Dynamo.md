# Soaring Dynamo
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You've built clockwork wings or jets into your dynamo, allowing you to use your prosthesis to fly. You gain a fly Speed equal to your Speed. Each minute of flight reduces the operational time of your sterling dynamo by 1 hour, measured from the first time you use the Fly action in a given minute.
