# Torrent in the Blood
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

A healing wave splashes across creatures in a 30 foot cone, its cleansing water driving afflictions from the body. Each creature in the area regains 3d8 HP and can attempt a new save against one poison or disease affliction affecting it; on a failed save, the condition doesn't worsen.

Each creature that benefited from this impulse becomes temporarily immune to Torrent in the Blood for 10 minutes.

* * *

**Level (+2)** The healing increases by 1d8.
