# Scalding Spit
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your bodily fluids burn with surprising volatility, as if you ran on oil instead of blood. As long as you are taking [[Persistent Damage|Persistent Fire Damage]], you gain a boiling spit ranged unarmed attack with a range of 30 feet that deals 1d6 fire damage.
