# Greater Cruelty
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

The extent of the corruption within you does more than simply sap your foes' strength, it devastates their minds and reflexes.

When you use [[Cruelty]], choose whether you want to make the creature enfeebled as normal, to make it [[Clumsy 1]] on a failed save (clumsy 2 on a critical failure), or to make it [[Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] on a failed save (stupefied 2 on a critical failure).
