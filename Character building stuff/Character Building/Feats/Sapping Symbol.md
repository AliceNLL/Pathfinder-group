# Sapping Symbol
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** While you have your symbol raised, you are about to take damage from a melee attack.

* * *

Your religious symbol glows with sacred energy, turning the attacker's strength to weakness. Attempt a religion check against the triggering creature's Will DC. Regardless of the result, the creature is temporarily immune for 1 minute.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature is [[Enfeebled 1|Enfeebled 2]] until it spends at least 1 action moving away from you.

**Success** As critical success, but [[Enfeebled 1]].
