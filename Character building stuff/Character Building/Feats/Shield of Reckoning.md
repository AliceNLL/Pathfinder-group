# Shield of Reckoning
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** A foe's attack against an ally matches the trigger for both your Shield Block reaction and your champion's reaction

* * *

When you shield your ally against an attack, you call upon your power to protect your ally further. You use the Shield Block reaction to prevent damage to an ally and also use your champion's reaction against the foe that attacked your ally.
