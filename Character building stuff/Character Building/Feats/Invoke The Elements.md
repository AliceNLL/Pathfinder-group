# Invoke The Elements
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

You summon an aura of shimmering heat, flurrying snow, crashing waves, or swirling wind and lightning.

For 1 minute, you gain [[Concealed|Concealment]] against creatures more than 5 feet away, and any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of you suffers `dice: 1d12` damage (basic Reflex save using your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher). At 13th and 17th level, this damage increases by 1d12.

A veil may changeling deals fire damage, a snow may changeling deals cold damage, a brine may changeling deals bludgeoning damage and the effect gains the water trait, and a virga may changeling deals electricity damage.
