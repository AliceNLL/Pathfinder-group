# Retch Rust
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You exhale tendrils formed from flakes of rusted metal. All creatures in a 30-Foot Cone take 4d10 slashing damage with a DC 0 Basic Fortitude save against your class DC. A metal creature that fails its save also takes 2d4 persistent slashing damage.

* * *

**Level (+2)** The cloud's slashing damage increases by 1d10 and the persistent damage increases by 1d4.
