# Coughing Dragon Display
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

This display emits a cascade of loud bangs or glittering trails. While you initially designed the display to captivate your audience's attention, it turns out to have a surprisingly effective use in combat, suppressing auditory or visual effects behind your magnificent display. You gain the [[Coughing Dragon]] fireworks display.
