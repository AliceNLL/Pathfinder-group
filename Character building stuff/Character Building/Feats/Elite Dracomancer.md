# Elite Dracomancer
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your magic rivals that of lesser dragons. Choose one 3rd-level spell and one 4th-level spell from those listed for a dragon spellcaster of your draconic exemplar's type (such as _[[Paralyze]]_ and _[[Stinking Cloud]]_ for a black dragon exemplar).

You can cast each of these spells once per day as arcane innate spells.
