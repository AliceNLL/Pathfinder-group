# Bloodline Metamorphosis
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You have learned to manipulate the innate power of your bloodline and adapt it to your needs. When making your daily preparations, you can swap out a single spell of 9th level or lower for another spell of the same level. You can't swap out spells granted specifically by your bloodline.
