# Medical Researcher
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Kassi has taught you not only how to apply medicines with your medical skills but how to craft them as well. When you [[Craft]] healer's kits, vaccines, addiction suppressants, antidotes, antiplagues, elixirs of life, or other non-magical medical or healing items, you can use Medicine instead of Crafting.
