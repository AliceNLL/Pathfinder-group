You strategically craft your debilitations to lessen or negate an enemy's tactical advantages. Add the following debilitations to the list you can choose from when you use Debilitating Strike.

*   **Debilitation** The target can't flank or contribute to allies' flanking.
*   **Debilitation** The target doesn't gain a circumstance bonus to AC from [[Raise a Shield|Raising a Shield]], lesser cover, or standard cover; it gains a +2 circumstance bonus to AC only from greater cover or [[Take Cover|Taking Cover]].
