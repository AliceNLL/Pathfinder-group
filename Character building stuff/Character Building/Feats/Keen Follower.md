# Keen Follower
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your keen observation of your allies has made you better at following their lead.

When using the [[Follow the Expert]] activity in exploration mode, you gain a +3 circumstance bonus if the ally you are following is an expert and a +4 circumstance bonus if your ally is a master.
