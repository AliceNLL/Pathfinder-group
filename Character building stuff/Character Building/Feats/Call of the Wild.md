# Call of the Wild
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You call upon the creatures of nature to come to your aid. You can spend 10 minutes in concert with nature to replace a spell you've prepared in one of your druid spell slots with a [[Summon Animal]] or [[Summon Plant or Fungus]] spell of the same rank.
