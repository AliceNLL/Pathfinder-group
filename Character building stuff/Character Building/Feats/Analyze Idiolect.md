# Analyze Idiolect
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You break down a specific individual's idiolect, memorizing their speech mannerisms and habits.

If you interact with someone for at least 10 minutes, when you later attempt to [[Impersonate]] that individual, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to your Deception checks and DCs. Due to the intense character study required, you can't remember more than one idiolect at a time.
