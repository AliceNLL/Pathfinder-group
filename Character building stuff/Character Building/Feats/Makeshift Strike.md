# Makeshift Strike
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You quickly snatch up whatever's nearby and then attack with it as an improvised weapon.

You [[Interact]] to pick up a nearby object you could use as an improvised weapon. It must be located at around your chest level, such as a mug on a table, rather than an object on the floor. You then either Strike or make an [[Improvised Pummel]] with the improvised weapon.
