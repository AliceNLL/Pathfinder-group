# Hardwood Armor
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Wood and bark grow over your body like armor. This hardwood armor is medium armor but uses your highest armor proficiency. The wooden armor's statistics are: AC Bonus +3; Dex Cap +2; Check Penalty –2; Speed Penalty –5 feet; Strength 14; Bulk 1; Group wood TV . Any bonuses, runes, and magical abilities of your actual armor are suppressed, but any runes that could apply to the hardwood armor are replicated onto it.

When you use this impulse, you can also create a wooden shield in a free hand. You can Shield Block with this shield even if you don't have that feat. The hand wielding this shield counts as a free hand for using impulses. The shield decays in an instant if it becomes broken or leaves your grasp.

The armor lasts for 10 minutes, and you can Dismiss this impulse. If you use this impulse again, any existing one ends.

* * *

**Level (+3)** The shield's Hardness increases by 1, its HP by 4, and its BT by 2.
