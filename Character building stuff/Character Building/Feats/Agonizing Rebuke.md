# Agonizing Rebuke
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

When you terrorize your enemies, you also cause them painful mental distress. When you successfully [[Demoralize]] a foe, that foe takes 1d4 mental damage at the start of each of its turns as long as it remains [[Frightened]] and continues to engage in combat with you. If you have master proficiency in Intimidation, the damage increases to 2d4 mental{2d4}, and if you have legendary proficiency, the damage increases to 3d4 mental{3d4}.
