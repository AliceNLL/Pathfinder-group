# Unlimited Ghost Flight
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You put your connection to the material world farther behind you. Your fly Speed no longer restricts the height you can fly. When you use [[Ghost Flight]], instead of its normal effect, you gain a +10-foot status bonus to your fly Speed for 10 minutes.
