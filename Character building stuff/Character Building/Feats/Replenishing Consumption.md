# Replenishing Consumption
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

When you devour corpses and satiate your hunger, you also recover from some of your wounds, your necrotized blue flesh knitting back together almost immediately as soon as you begin shoveling the chunks of dead flesh down your throat. Once every 10 minutes, when you [[Consume Flesh]], you regain 1d6 Hit Points for every 2 levels you have, rounded up.
