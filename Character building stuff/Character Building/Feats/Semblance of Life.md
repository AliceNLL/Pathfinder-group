# Semblance of Life
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** You deal damage to a living creature with your fist Strike or with Desiccating Inhalation.

* * *

You draw the moisture you've drained from others into your own flesh, temporarily taking on the appearance of life. This has the effects of _[[Illusory Disguise]]_, except you can appear only as yourself while you were a living humanoid.
