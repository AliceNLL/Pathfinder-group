# Quicksoul
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

The elemental metal in your bloodline literally courses through your veins in the form of liquid metals like mercury, rubidium, gallium, and djezet, giving your actions a languid fluidity. You gain the trained proficiency rank in Acrobatics. If you would automatically become trained in Acrobatics (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. As these metals are largely toxic to organic life, you also gain the Toxic Touch action.

**Toxic Touch** 1 (poison)

**Frequency** once per day

**Requirements** Your most recent action was to [[Tumble Through]], and you successfully moved through an enemy's space

* * *

**Effect** Make a melee unarmed Strike against the enemy whose space you moved through. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 persistent,poison damage and is [[Sickened 1]] (or takes 2d6 persistent poison and is [[Sickened 1|Sickened 2]] on a critical hit).
