# One with the Land
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your connection to your bound terrain strengthens, making you unhindered by local weather. When in your bound terrain, you ignore the effects of non-magical difficult terrain. In addition, your experience from your bound terrain lets you ignore circumstance penalties to visual Perception checks and ignore concealment caused by certain environmental effects. The types you ignore depend on your bound terrain.

**Arctic** Ice or snow

**Desert** Dust or sand

**Mountain** Clouds or mist

**Swamp** Rain or murky water
