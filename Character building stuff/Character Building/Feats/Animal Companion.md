# Animal Companion
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

An animal companion is a loyal comrade who follows your orders. Your animal companion has the animal and minion traits, and it gains 2 actions during your turn if you use the Command an Animal action to command it; this replaces the usual effects of Command an Animal, and you don’t need to attempt a Nature check. If your companion dies, you can spend a week of downtime to replace it at no cost. You can have only one animal companion at a time.

### YOUNG ANIMAL COMPANIONS

The following are the base statistics for a young animal companion, the first animal companion most characters get. You adjust these statistics depending on the type of animal you choose. Animal companions calculate their modifiers and DCs just as you do with one difference: the only item bonuses they can benefit from are to Speed and AC (their maximum item bonus to AC is +3). As you gain levels, you might be able to make your companion stronger by advancing it as described in [[Companion Advancement]].

An animal companion’s starting statistics are as follows.

**Level:** Your animal companion’s level is equal to yours.

**Proficiencies:** Your animal companion is trained in its unarmed attacks, unarmored defense, barding (a type of armor for animals), all saving throws, Perception, Acrobatics, and Athletics. Animal companions can’t use abilities that require greater Intelligence, such as Coerce or Decipher Writing, even if trained in the appropriate skill, unless they have a specialization that allows it.

**Attribute Modifiers:** An animal companion begins with base attribute modifiers listed in its stat block.

**Hit Points:** Your animal companion has ancestry Hit Points from its type, plus a number of Hit Points equal to 6 plus its Constitution modifier for each level you have.

### COMPANION TYPES

The species of animal you choose is called your companion’s type. Each companion type has its own statistics, as follows.

**Size** The companion’s size

**Unarmed Attacks** One or more entries with the companion’s unarmed attacks and their traits and damage

**Attribute Modifiers** Starting attribute modifiers

**Hit Points** The companion’s ancestry Hit Points

**Skill** An additional trained skill your companion has

**Senses** Special senses your companion has

**Speed** Your companion’s Speeds

**Special** If present, this lists any special ability your companion has, such as whether it often serves as a mount.

**Support Benefit** A special benefit you gain by Commanding the Animal to use the Support action (see below).

**Advanced Maneuver** A powerful new action your companion learns how to use if it becomes a nimble or savage animal companion.

### SUPPORT 

**Requirements** The creature is an animal companion.

Your animal companion supports you. You gain the benefits listed in the companion type’s Support Benefit entry. If the animal uses the Support action, the only other actions it can use on this turn are basic move actions to get into position to take advantage of the Support benefits; if it has already used any other action this turn, it can’t Support you.

### COMPANION ADVANCEMENT

You can advance an animal companion, usually due to one of your class feat choices. Normally, you can advance a young animal companion to a mature animal companion, advance a mature companion to either a nimble or savage companion, and advance a nimble or savage companion into a specialized companion.

#### MATURE ANIMAL COMPANIONS

When you advance a young animal companion to a mature animal companion:

- If your companion is Medium or smaller, it grows by one size.
- Increase its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, and Wisdom modifiers by 1.
- Increase its proficiency rank for Perception and all saving throws to expert. Increase its proficiency ranks in Intimidation, Stealth, and Survival to trained, and if it was already trained in one of those skills from its type, increase its proficiency rank in that skill to expert.
- Increase its unarmed attack damage from one die to two dice (for instance 1d8 to 2d8)

#### NIMBLE ANIMAL COMPANIONS

To advance a mature animal companion to a nimble animal companion:

- Increase its Dexterity modifier by 2 and its Strength, Constitution, and Wisdom modifiers by 1.
- Increase its proficiency ranks in Acrobatics to expert.
- It deals 2 additional damage with its unarmed attacks. Its attacks become magical for the purpose of ignoring resistances.
- It learns the advanced maneuver for its type.

#### SAVAGE ANIMAL COMPANIONS

To advance a mature animal companion to a savage animal companion:

- If your companion is Medium or smaller, it grows by one size.
- Increase its Strength modifier by 2 and its Dexterity, Constitution, and Wisdom modifiers by 1.
- Increase its proficiency rank in Athletics to expert.
- It deals 3 additional damage with its unarmed attacks. Its attacks become magical for the purpose of ignoring resistances.
- It learns the advanced maneuver for its type.

#### SPECIALIZED ANIMAL COMPANIONS

Specialized animal companions are more intelligent and engage in more complex behaviors. Most animal companions can have only one specialization. The first time an animal gains a specialization, it also gains the following.

- Its proficiency rank for unarmed attacks increases to expert.
- Its proficiency ranks for saving throws and Perception increase to master.
- Increase its Dexterity modifier by 1 and its Intelligence modifier by 2.
- Its unarmed attack damage increases from two dice to three dice, and it increases its additional damage with unarmed attacks from 2 to 4 or from 3 to 6.
- The extra benefit of the specialization listed below.

**Ambusher:** In your companion’s natural environment, it can use a Sneak action even if it’s currently observed. Its proficiency rank in Stealth increases to expert (or master if it was already an expert from its type), and its Dexterity modifier increases by 1. Its proficiency rank for unarmored defense increases to expert.

**Bully:** Your companion terrorizes foes with dominance displays and pushes them around the battlefield. Its proficiency ranks for Athletics and Intimidation increase to expert (or master if it was already expert from its type), its Strength modifier increases by 1, and its Charisma modifier increases by 3.

**Daredevil:** Your companion joins the fray with graceful leaps and dives. It gains the deny advantage ability, so it isn’t off-guard to hidden, undetected, or flanking creatures unless such a creature’s level is greater than yours. Its proficiency rank in Acrobatics increases to master, and its Dexterity modifier increases by 1. Its proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert.

**Racer:** Your companion races. It gains a +10-foot status bonus to its Speed, swim Speed, or fly Speed (your choice). Its proficiency in Fortitude saves increases to legendary, and its Constitution modifier increases by 1.

**Tracker:** Your companion is an incredible tracker. It can move at full Speed while following tracks. Its proficiency rank in Survival increases to expert (or master if it was already an expert from its type), and its Wisdom modifier increases by 1.

**Wrecker:** Your companion smashes things. Its unarmed attacks ignore half an object’s Hardness. Its Athletics proficiency increases to master, and its Strength modifier increases by 1.
