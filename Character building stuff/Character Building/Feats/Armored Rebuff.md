# Armored Rebuff
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** An adjacent foe critically fails an attack roll to Strike you with a melee weapon or unarmed attack.

**Requirements** You are wearing medium armor or heavier.

* * *

You rebuff puny attacks with your armor, knocking back your foe. Attempt an Athletics check to [[Shove]] the triggering foe, even if you don't have a hand free. If you succeed, you can't Stride to follow the foe, as you're knocking the foe back with the rebounded attack, not by physically moving towards them.
