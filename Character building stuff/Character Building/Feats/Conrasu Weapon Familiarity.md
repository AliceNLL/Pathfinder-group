You have taken it upon yourself to learn the ways of combat to aid with your tasks, perhaps in a role as a corrector. You are trained with the [[Composite Shortbow]], [[Glaive]], [[Longspear]], [[Longsword]], [[Shortbow]], and [[Spear]]. You also gain access to all uncommon conrasu weapons([[Buugeng]]). For the purpose of determining your proficiency, martial conrasu weapons are simple weapons and advanced conrasu weapons are martial weapons.
