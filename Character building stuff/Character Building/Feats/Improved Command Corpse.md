# Improved Command Corpse
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

When you use [[Command Undead]] on a mindless undead, if the undead succeeds at its save but doesn't critically succeed, it becomes your minion for 1 round. If the undead fails its save, it becomes your minion for 1 hour. If it critically fails, it becomes your minion for 24 hours.
