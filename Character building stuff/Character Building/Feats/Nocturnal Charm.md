# Nocturnal Charm
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

The supernatural charm of your vampiric progenitor hangs about you, and you've learned to use it on mortals. Against humanoids (or other creatures of your type, if you're not a humanoid), you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Deception checks to [[Lie]], and to Diplomacy checks to [[Gather Information]] and [[Make an Impression]].
