# Battle Cry
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

When you roll initiative, you can yell a mighty battle cry and [[Demoralize]] an observed foe as a free action. If you're legendary in Intimidation, you can use a reaction to Demoralize your foe when you critically succeed at an attack roll.
