# Awakened Power
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your power spontaneously evolves or reconfigures itself. You gain one awakening benefit for a deviant feat of 4th level or lower.

* * *

**Special** You can take this feat multiple times. Each time you do, choose a different deviant feat of 4th level or lower, and gain one of its awakening benefits.
