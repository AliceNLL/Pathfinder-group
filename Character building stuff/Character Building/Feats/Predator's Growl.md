# Predator's Growl
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** You successfully [[Seek]] a hidden or undetected creature.

* * *

You give a throaty growl to attempt to [[Demoralize]] a creature you just found. You don't take the -4 penalty for not sharing a language with the creature.
