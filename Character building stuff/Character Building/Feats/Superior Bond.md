# Superior Bond
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

When you draw upon your bonded item, you can leave a bit of energy within it for later use. You can use [[Drain Bonded Item]] one additional time per day, but only to cast a spell 2 or more ranks lower than your highest-rank wizard spell slot.
