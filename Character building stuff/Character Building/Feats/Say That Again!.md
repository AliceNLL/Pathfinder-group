# Say That Again!
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** An opponent gets a critical failure when attempting to [[Demoralize]] you or Lie to you.

* * *

The world is full of obnoxious weasels who think they can pull one over on you-put them in their place! When an adjacent creature attempts to Lie to you or to Demoralize you and gets a critical failure on the roll, you can use your reaction to make a [[Shove]] attempt against that opponent. If combat results, you can roll Intimidation for your initiative check.
