# Improved Swift Banishment
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You easily banish creatures with your weapon. You can use [[Swift Banishment]] as long as you have a spell slot of 5th rank or higher remaining, even if you don't have [[Banishment]] prepared. You must sacrifice a prepared spell of 5th rank or higher, and the _banishment_ effect you create is heightened to the rank of that spell. The target takes a â€“2 circumstance penalty to its save as though you'd paid the extra cost for _banishment_.
