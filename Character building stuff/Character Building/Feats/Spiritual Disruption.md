# Spiritual Disruption
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You channel disruptive power that severs a foe's spiritual connection to their heretical magic. Make a melee Strike. If the attack hits, any time the target attempts to cast a divine or occult spell, the spell is disrupted unless they succeed at a DC 5 flat on a critical hit); if the target is also [[Stupefied]], it must attempt the harder of the two flat checks (but not both). This effect lasts for 1 minute.
