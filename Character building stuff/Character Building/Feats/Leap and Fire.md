# Leap and Fire
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You're quick enough to line up a shot even while diving to the ground. When you use your Hit the Dirt! reaction, at any point during your Leap you can also make a ranged Strike with a loaded firearm or crossbow, targeting the creature whose attack triggered the reaction.
