# Jalmeri Heavenseeker Dedication
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You become trained in either Acrobatics or Occultism; if you were already trained in both these skills, you become an expert in one of them instead. You gain either the [[Ki Rush]] or [[Ki Strike]] monk feat, which grants you a ki spell and a focus pool of 1 Focus Point that you can recover using the [[Refocus]] activity as a monk does. If you already have both feats, you can instead choose a single 1st‚Äêlevel monk feat.

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you gain two other feats from the [[Jalmeri Heavenseeker]] or [[Student of Perfection]] archetypes.
