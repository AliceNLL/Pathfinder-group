![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your connection to the Boneyard empowers you to bring death to all forms of life and unlife, exploiting their weaknesses.

All your weapon and unarmed Strikes are magical and deal 1 additional void damage to living creatures and 1 additional vitality damage to undead.
