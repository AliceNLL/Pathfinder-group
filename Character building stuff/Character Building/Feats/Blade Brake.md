**Trigger** You would be moved by a forced movement effect.

**Requirements** You are wielding a melee weapon and are within reach of a hard surface.

* * *

You plow your weapon into a floor, wall, or another sturdy surface, anchoring yourself in place. If you would be moved 20 feet or more, you are moved only 5 feet. Otherwise, you don't move at all.
