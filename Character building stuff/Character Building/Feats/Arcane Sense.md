# Arcane Sense
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your study of magic allows you to instinctively sense its presence. You can cast 1st-rank [[Detect Magic]] at will as an arcane innate spell. If you're a master in Arcana, the spell is heightened to 3rd rank; if you're legendary, it is heightened to 4th rank.
