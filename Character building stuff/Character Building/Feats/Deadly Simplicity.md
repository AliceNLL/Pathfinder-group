# Deadly Simplicity
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

When you are wielding your deity's favored weapon, increase the damage die size of that weapon by one step.

If your deity's favored weapon is an unarmed attack (such as a fist, if you worship [[Irori]]) and its damage die is smaller than d6, instead increase its damage die size to d6.
