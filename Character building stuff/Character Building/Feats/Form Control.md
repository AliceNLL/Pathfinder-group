# Form Control

With additional care and effort, you can take on an alternate shape for a longer period of time. If your next action is to cast untamed form, the spell's rank is 2 lower than normal (minimum 1st rank), but you can remain transformed for up to 1 hour or the listed duration (whichever is longer). You can still Dismiss untamed form as normal.
