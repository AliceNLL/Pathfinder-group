# Incredible Ricochet
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

After your first shot singles out your opponent's position, you direct another that ricochets around obstacles and strikes unerringly. Make a ranged weapon Strike against a creature you previously attacked this turn. You ignore the target's [[Concealed]] condition and all cover.
