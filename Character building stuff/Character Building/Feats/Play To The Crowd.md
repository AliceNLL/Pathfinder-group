![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** You reduce an enemy to 0 Hit Points during a non-trivial combat encounter with spectators.

* * *

You show off for the crowd. Attempt a Performance check; the DC is determined by the GM but is typically the standard DC for your level or the DC to [[Make an Impression]] on the spectators, whichever is higher. On a success, choose one of the following benefits; on a critical success, choose two benefits:

*   A number of temporary Hit Points equal to your character level; these last for 1 minute.
*   A +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the end of your next turn.
*   A +1 circumstance bonus to your next attack roll before the end of your next turn.
