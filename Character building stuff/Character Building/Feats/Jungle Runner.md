# Jungle Runner
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You run through the jungle as easily as you would through an open field. You ignore difficult terrain from underbrush within forests and jungles. You can always use the [[Take Cover]] action when you're within forest or jungle terrain to gain cover, even if you aren't adjacent to an obstacle you can Take Cover behind.
