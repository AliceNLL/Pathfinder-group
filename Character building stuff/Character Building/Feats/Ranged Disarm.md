# Ranged Disarm
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** You're wielding a simple firearm.

* * *

When using a simple firearm, you can shoot objects right out of your enemy's hands. Attempt to [[Disarm]] the target using a ranged attack roll with your simple firearm, instead of attempting an athletics check against the target's Reflex DC.
