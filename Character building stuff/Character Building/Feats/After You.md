# After You
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** You're about to roll initiative.

* * *

You allow your foes to make the first move in a show of incredible confidence. You don't roll initiative; instead you voluntarily go last. You gain [[Panache]].

If more than one character uses this ability or another ability to go last, use the normal rules for resolving a tie: NPCs and monsters act before PCs, and within those groups, the creatures can choose whichever order they want.
