# Improved Dueling Riposte
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your weapon whirls and darts, striking foes whenever the slightest opening or moment of weakness presents itself. You can use [[Dueling Riposte]] even if you aren't benefiting from [[Dueling Parry (Fighter)|Dueling Parry]]. At the start of each of your turns, you gain an additional reaction that you can use only to make a Dueling Riposte.
