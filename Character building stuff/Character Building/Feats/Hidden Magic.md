# Hidden Magic
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You've learned to hide the magical auras of your gear. During your daily preparations, you carefully tweak any or all of your magic items to appear non-magical. Objects adjusted in this way remain so until your next preparations.

A spellcaster using _[[Detect Magic]]_ or _[[Read Aura]]_ must succeed at a Perception check against your Deception DC to see through your obfuscations.
