# Ravenous Charge
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Hungry for the flesh of the living, you hurl yourself into the fray, teeth gnashing. You Stride. If you end your movement within melee reach of a living creature, you can make an Athletics check to [[Grapple]] that creature. If you succeed, you then make a jaws Strike against that creature.
