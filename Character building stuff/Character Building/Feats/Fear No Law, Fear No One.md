# Fear No Law, Fear No One
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

When you roll a success on a save against a fear effect, you get a critical success instead. In addition, any time you gain the [[Frightened]] condition, reduce the condition's value by 1. As usual, this ability reduces the initial frightened condition by 1, so if you have multiple similar abilities, they don't both take effect.
