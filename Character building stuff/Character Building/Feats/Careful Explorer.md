# Careful Explorer
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You've explored enough dusty tombs and hidden vaults to gain a sixth sense about traps, and you sometimes notice them even when you're not trying to. Even if you aren't Searching in exploration mode, you get a check to find traps that normally require you to Search for them. You still need to meet any other requirements to find the trap.
