# Lightning Rod
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You smash a metal rod into your foe and call lightning to it. Attempt a 1-action melee Elemental Blast using the metal element. On a hit, the target is skewered with a metal rod, which gives it a –1 circumstance penalty to AC and saves against electricity; the penalty is –2 if the creature also has the metal trait, is made of metal, or is wearing metal armor. A hit creature immediately takes 1d12 electricity  damage with a DC resolve reflex check to pull the lightning rod free.

* * *

**Level (+6)** The electricity damage increases by 1d12.
