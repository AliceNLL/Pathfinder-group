![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You imbue yourself with the resilience of the cave worm. When you gain the [[Paralyzed]], [[Slowed|Slowed]], or [[Stunned 1|Stunned]] condition, roll a DC 15 flat. On a success you ignore the condition.

When using Worm Form you are immune to penalties to your Speed and the [[Immobilized]] condition, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your Fortitude or Reflex DC against attempts to [[Shove]] or [[Trip]] you, and you ignore difficult terrain and greater difficult terrain.
