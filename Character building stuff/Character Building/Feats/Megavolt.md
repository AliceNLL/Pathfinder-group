# Megavolt
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You bleed off some electric power from your innovation in the shape of a damaging bolt. Creatures in a 20 foot line from your innovation take 3d4 electricity damage, with a DC resolve reflex{leveled electricity damage}

**Unstable Function** You overload and supercharge the voltage even higher. Add the unstable trait to Megavolt. The area increases to a 60 foot line and the damage increases from d4s to d12s leveled electricity damage (d12). If you have the breakthrough innovation class feature, you can choose a 60-foot or 90 foot line for the area when you use an unstable Megavolt; if you also have the revolutionary innovation class feature, you can choose a 60-foot, 90-foot, or 120 foot line.

DC 17 flat{Unstable Check}

**Special** If your innovation is a minion, it can take this action rather than you.
