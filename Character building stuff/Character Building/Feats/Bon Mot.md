# Bon Mot
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You launch an insightful quip at a foe, distracting them. Choose a foe within 30 feet and roll a Diplomacy check against the target's Will DC.

* * *

**Critical Success** The target is distracted and takes a -3 status penalty to Perception and Will saves for 1 minute.

The target can end the effect early with a retort to your Bon Mot. This can either be a single action that has the concentrate trait or an appropriate skill action to frame their retort. The GM determines which skill actions qualify, though they must take at least 1 action. Typically, the retort needs to use a linguistic Charisma-based skill action.

**Success** As critical success, but the penalty is -2.

**Critical Failure** Your quip is atrocious. You take the same penalty an enemy would take had you succeeded. This ends after 1 minute or if you issue another Bon Mot and succeed.
