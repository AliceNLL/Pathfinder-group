# Advanced Construct Companion
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You've upgraded your construct companion's power and decision-making ability. It becomes an advanced construct companion. During an encounter, even if you don't use the Command a Minion action, your construct companion can still use 1 action on your turn that round to Stride or Strike.
