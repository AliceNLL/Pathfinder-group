# Herbalist Dedication
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You can create remedies and other herbal products. You gain the basic alchemy benefits, though they apply only for herbal items: alchemical items with the healing trait, plus [[Antidote (Lesser)|Antidote]] and [[Antiplague (Lesser)|Antiplague]].

You gain batches of infused reagents per day equal to your level or half your level if you didn't make your daily preparations in the wilderness. Your [[Advanced Alchemy]] level for creating these is 1 and doesn't increase on its own.

You become an expert in Nature and can use Nature instead of Crafting to [[Craft]] herbal items. You don't need to be trained in Crafting or have the [[Alchemical Crafting]] feat to do so, and you can use a [[Healer's Toolkit]] instead of an [[Alchemist's Toolkit]].

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the [[Herbalist]] archetype.
