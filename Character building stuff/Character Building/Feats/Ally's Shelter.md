# Ally's Shelter
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** You attempt a saving throw while adjacent to one or more allies, but you haven't rolled yet.

* * *

In stressful circumstances, you find strength in your allies' example. Roll the save using an adjacent ally's modifier for that type of saving throw instead of your own.
