# First World Magic
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your connection to the First World grants you a primal innate spell, much like those of the fey. Choose one cantrip from the primal spell list. You can cast this spell as a primal innate spell at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell rank equal to half your level rounded up.
