# Savage Critical
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

The wounds you inflict are grievous. When you Strike with a weapon or unarmed attack for which you have legendary proficiency, you critically succeed if you roll a 19 on the die as long as that result would be a success. This has no effect on a 19 if the result would be a failure.
