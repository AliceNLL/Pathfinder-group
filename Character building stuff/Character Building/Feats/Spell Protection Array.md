# Spell Protection Array
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You inscribe a circle of arcane runes that dampen enemies' magic. You create a glowing magic circle in a 5 foot burst within 30 feet. Creatures in the circle gain a +1 status bonus to saving throws against magic. The circle lasts until the end of your next turn, and you can Sustain it, to a maximum duration of 1 minute.
