# Pirate Weapon Training
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You're particularly skilled at wielding traditional pirate weapons. You become trained with the following weapons: [[Hatchet]], [[Rapier]], [[Scimitar]], and [[Whip]].

Whenever you gain a class feature that grants you expert or greater proficiency with a given weapon or weapons, you also gain that proficiency rank for these weapons.
