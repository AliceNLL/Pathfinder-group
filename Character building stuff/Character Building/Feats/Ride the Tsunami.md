# Ride the Tsunami
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Booming, crashing walls of water, enough to fill a harbor, smash out ahead of you, overwhelming all in their path. The waves move forward in your choice of a 60 foot cone or 120 foot line. If you're in water, you can increase these waves to a 90 foot cone or 180 foot line. Each creature in the area takes 10d10 bludgeoning damage with a DC resolve reflex save against your class DC. A creature that fails its save is pushed 20 feet (or 40 feet on a critical failure). Any unattended object of 1 Bulk or less in the area is pushed to the far edge of the area. The sheer mass of water extinguishes all non-magical flames in the area.

As the wave crashes down, you can catch it to your destination. After the impulse deals damage, you can Swim in a straight line to any point in its area before the water disappears.
