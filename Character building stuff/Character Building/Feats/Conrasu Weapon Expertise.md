![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Whenever you gain a class feature that grants you expert or greater proficiency in certain weapons, you also gain that proficiency for [[Composite Shortbow]], [[Glaive]], [[Longspear]], [[Longsword]], [[Shortbow]], [[Spear]], and all conrasu weapons([[Buugeng]]) in which you are trained.
