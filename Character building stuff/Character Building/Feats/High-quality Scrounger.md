# High-quality Scrounger
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

When you [[Craft]] a temporary item using Scrounger Dedication, it can be an item of up to 3rd level (though the item must still be a weapon, armor, or a nonconsumable piece of adventuring gear).

You can instead Craft it for someone else's use, allowing them to avoid taking the penalty for using a shoddy item when using it, but causing you to take the penalty if you use it.
