# Violent Unleash
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** You Unleash your Psyche.

* * *

The force of your mind unleashing itself wracks your enemies with a violent shockwave. You deal 2d6 force damage to all creatures in a 20 foot emanation, with a basic Reflex save. This explosion is taxing, making you [[Stunned 1]]. At 5th level and every 2 levels thereafter, the damage increases by 1d6.
