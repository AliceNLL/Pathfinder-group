# Golem Dynamo
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You've learned the secrets of Jistkan golem prostheses, allowing you to incorporate golem components into your dynamo and gain a portion of their magic. You gain a +1 status bonus to saving throws against magic, and your dynamo Strikes become magical.
