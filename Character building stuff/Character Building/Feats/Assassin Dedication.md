# Assassin Dedication
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You've trained to assassinate your foes, and you do so with tenacity and precision. You gain the [[Mark for Death]] activity.

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two other feats from the [[Assassin]] archetype.
