# Assured Knowledge
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You can procure information with confidence. Whenever you [[Recall Knowledge]] using any skill (including Bardic Lore), you can forgo rolling your check to instead receive a result of 10 + your proficiency bonus (don't apply any other bonuses, penalties, or modifiers).

As long as you are an expert in a skill, you meet the prerequisites for the [[Automatic Knowledge]] skill feat in that skill, even if you don't have [[Assurance]] in that skill.
