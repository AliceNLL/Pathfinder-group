You have expanded your supply of near-infinite items. Choose a research field. Add one item from the list of options available to that field from perpetual infusions, or two items if you choose your own field.

If you have [[Perpetual Potency (Toxicologist)|Perpetual Potency]] or [[Perpetual Perfection (Toxicologist)|Perpetual Perfection]], you gain an additional item (or items if you chose your own field) appropriate to the field you chose, for instance a higher-level version of the bomb you chose or a new poison.
