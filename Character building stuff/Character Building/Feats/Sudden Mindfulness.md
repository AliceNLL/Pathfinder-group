# Sudden Mindfulness
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** You roll a success on a saving throw against an effect that would make you [[Fascinated]] or [[Dazzled]].

* * *

Your mind retains full awareness despite the best attempts of others, and your focus throws others off-balance. You get a critical success on the triggering saving throw, and if the triggering effect was caused by a creature, that creature is [[Off-Guard]] to you until the end of your next turn.
