# Known Weaknesses
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Whenever you [[Devise a Stratagem|Devise a Strategem]], you can also attempt a check to [[Recall Knowledge]] as part of that action. If you critically succeed at the Recall Knowledge check, you notice a weakness and gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your attack roll from Devise a Stratagem.

If you immediately convey this information to your allies as part of the check, each ally gains a +1 circumstance bonus to their next attack roll against the subject, as long as their attack is made before the beginning of your next turn.
