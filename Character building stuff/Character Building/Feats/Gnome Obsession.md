# Gnome Obsession
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You might have a flighty nature, but when a topic captures your attention, you dive into it headfirst. You gain the [[Additional Lore]] feat and the [[Assurance]] feat for the chosen Lore. As gnome obsessions can come and go quickly, you can retrain Gnome Obsession to a different Lore subcategory in 1 day of downtime.
