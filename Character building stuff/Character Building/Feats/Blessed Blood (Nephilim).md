![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your spilled blood is sanctified, with effects similar to those of [[Holy Water]]. Whenever a fiend, undead, or creature with a weakness to holy drinks your blood or deals piercing or slashing damage to you with jaws, fangs, or a similar attack, that creature takes 1d6 spirit:holy damage with the holy trait. You gain a +4 circumstance bonus to Crafting checks to [[Craft]] _holy water_ using your blood as one of the ingredients.
