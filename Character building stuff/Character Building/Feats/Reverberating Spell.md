# Reverberating Spell
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your spell disorients your targets with a metallic clangor. If the next action you use this turn is to Cast a non-cantrip Spell that deals damage in an area (such as a burst, line, or cone), the spell deals an additional 1d8 sonic damage and all creatures who fail their save against the spell are [[Deafened]] for 1 round. Targets who critically fail their saves against this spell are instead deafened for 1 minute. The spell gains the sonic trait.
