# Dodge Away
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** You are the target of a melee attack.

**Requirements** You're aware of the attack and aren't [[Off-Guard]].

* * *

You use your acrobatic prowess to evade an attack, using momentum to keep yourself moving, if you choose.

You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to AC against the triggering attack. If the attack misses you, you can [[Step]] after the Strike.

If you're a master in Acrobatics, you can move 10 feet on this Step instead of 5 feet.
