# Favorable Winds
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You wrap a shell of favorable wind around a weapon you wield. On your next Strike with a ranged weapon before the start of your next turn, you don't take circumstance penalties on the attack roll due to wind. In addition, if that weapon has a range increment of 10 feet or less, increase its range increment by 10 feet for that Strike.
