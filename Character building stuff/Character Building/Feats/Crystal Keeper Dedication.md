# Crystal Keeper Dedication
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You can use Arcana, Occultism, Religion, or Society to Decipher Writing by meditating before a crystal, regardless of the type of writing. When you Decipher Writing and roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead, and when you Decipher Writing and roll a success, you get a critical success instead.

Additionally, you gain resistance 10 to damage from hazards associated with crystals.

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the [[Crystal Keeper]] archetype.
