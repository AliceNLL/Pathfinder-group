# Ambush Bladderwort
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You plant the seed of a giant bladderwort in an unoccupied square of ground or water within 30 feet. It lasts for 10 minutes. Using this impulse again ends any previous one. If a creature enters its square, the seed erupts into a voluminous, translucent plant that seals tight around the triggering creature and fills with water. Unless the creature succeeds at a DC resolve reflex save against your class DC, it's [[Immobilized]] within the bladderwort and must hold its breath or begin drowning. The [[Escape]] DC is also your class DC. The plant has AC 10 and 50 Hit Points.

If a creature dies inside it, the plant shrinks down, converting itself and the remains into a watery fruit. A creature can eat this consumable to regain 1d8+4 HP, after which that creature is temporarily immune for 10 minutes. This fruit rots after 1 hour.

* * *

**Level (+4)** The bladderwort's HP increase by 25 and the fruit's healing increases by 1d8+4.
