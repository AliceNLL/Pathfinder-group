# Mariner's Fire
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You conjure uncanny orbs of spiritual flame that float above or below the water's surface. You can cast the _[[Produce Flame]]_ cantrip as a primal innate spell at will, heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up. You can cast this cantrip underwater.
