# Black Cat Curse
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** A creature within 30 feet you can see would succeed at a save.

* * *

You hiss a spiteful curse at the creature. The target must reroll the triggering saving throw and use the worse result.
