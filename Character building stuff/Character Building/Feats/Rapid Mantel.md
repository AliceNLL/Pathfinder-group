# Rapid Mantel
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You easily pull yourself onto ledges. When you [[Grab an Edge]], you can pull yourself onto that surface and stand. You can use Athletics instead of a Reflex save to Grab an Edge. If you Climb or [[Leap]] to within 5 feet beneath the top of an edge, you can pull yourself onto the surface and stand as part of that action.
