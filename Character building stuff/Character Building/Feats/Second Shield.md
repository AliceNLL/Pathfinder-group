# Second Shield
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** Your [[Shield Block]] causes your shield to break or be destroyed.

* * *

You're used to your shield breaking in the middle of battle, and you're prepared to use a backup or any convenient nearby object to defend yourself.

You can [[Interact]] to draw a shield on your person or an unattended shield within your reach. If there is an object within your reach that could serve as an improvised shield-for example, a table or chair-you can Interact to draw it with this feat. The GM determines if something can be used as an improvised shield.

Your new shield isn't raised until you use the [[Raise a Shield]] action, as normal.
