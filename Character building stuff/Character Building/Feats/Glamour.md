# Glamour
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You unlock a new level of fey power and can manipulate the perceptions of others using a font of First World magic. You gain the _[[Fey Glamour]]_ focus spell as a primal spell that doesn't have the sorcerer trait. If you don't already have a focus pool, you gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point.

**Special** This feat gains the trait appropriate for your ancestry (human for human, goblin for goblin, etc.).
