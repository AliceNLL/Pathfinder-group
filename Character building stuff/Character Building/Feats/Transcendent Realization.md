# Transcendent Realization
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You've unleashed even more of your mind's limitless potential. Choose a 3rd-level occult spell, either a common spell or another to which you have access, including a lower-level spell heightened to 3rd level if you wish. You can cast that spell once per day as an innate occult spell.
