# Dragonslayer Oath
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You've sworn to slay wicked and nefarious dragons. You gain following edict: "You must slay dragons whose actions are in direct opposition to your deity's edicts when you encounter them as long as you have a reasonable chance of success."

Your [[Retributive Strike]] gains a +4 circumstance bonus to damage against a dragon, or +6 if you have master proficiency with the weapon you used.

Your [[Glimpse of Redemption|Glimpse of Redemption's]] resistance against damage from a dragon is 7 + your level.

If you use [[Liberating Step]] triggered by a dragon, your ally gains a +4 circumstance bonus to checks granted by your Liberating Step, and the ally can Step twice afterward.

You don't consider dragons whose actions are in direct opposition to your deity's edicts to be legitimate authorities, even in nations they rule.
