# Bullet Dancer Dedication
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You've learned how to synchronize traditional martial arts and guns. You gain the [[Bullet Dancer Stance]] action. Whenever your proficiency in any weapon increases to expert or beyond, you gain that new proficiency with bayonets, reinforced stocks, simple firearms and unarmed attacks.

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two other feats from the [[Bullet Dancer]] dedication archetype.
