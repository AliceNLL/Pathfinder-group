# Gruesome Strike
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** Your Strikes currently deal extra damage from your champion's reaction.

* * *

Make a Strike against the creature that triggered your champion's reaction. If you hit, the target takes double the extra damage from your reaction and must succeed at a Fortitude save against your class DC or be [[Drained 1]].

Regardless of the result, the creature is temporarily immune to your Gruesome Strike for 24 hours.
