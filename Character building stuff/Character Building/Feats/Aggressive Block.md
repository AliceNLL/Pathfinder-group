# Aggressive Block
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** You use the Shield Block reaction, and the opponent that triggered Shield Block is adjacent to you and is your size or smaller.

* * *

You push back as you block, knocking your foe away or off balance. You use your shield to push the triggering creature, either automatically Shoving it 5 feet or causing it to become [[Off-Guard]] until the start of your next turn. The triggering creature chooses whether to be moved or become off-guard. If it chooses to be moved, you choose the direction. If the [[Shove]] would cause it to hit a solid object, enter a square of difficult terrain, or enter another creature's space, it must become off-guard instead of being moved.
