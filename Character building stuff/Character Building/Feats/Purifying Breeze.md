**Requirements** Your most recent action was to cast a non-cantrip spell with the healing trait.

* * *

You transfer the divine essence of your magic to the air around you, cleansing it of toxins. Attempt a counteract check against each airborne disease or poison effect in a 15 foot emanation{15-foot radius} around you. Regardless of your success or failure, until the beginning of your next turn, all creatures in the purified area gain a +1 status bonus to Fortitude saving throws.
