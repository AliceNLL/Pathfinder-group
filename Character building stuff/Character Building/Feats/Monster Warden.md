![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You understand how to defend yourself and others against your prey. When you grant bonuses from Monster Hunter, you and your allies also each gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your next saving throw against that particular creature and to your AC against that creature's next attack against you.
