# Histrionic Injury
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Frequency** once per hour

**Trigger** A creature you can see damages you with a melee Strike.

* * *

You respond with a startled look, dramatic pratfall, or theatrical arm-flailing that stymies your attacker. The attacker must succeed at a Will saving throw against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher, or become [[Stupefied|Stupefied 1]] for 1 round ([[Stupefied|Stupefied 2]] on a critical failure).
