# Smoke Sight
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Access** You are from Dongun Hold or Alkenstar.

* * *

You're used to fighting and hiding in a haze of smoke and flame. You automatically succeed at the DC 5 flat check to target a [[Concealed]] creature if that creature is concealed only by smoke. When you are concealed or [[Hidden]] in smoke, increase the DC of the flat check to target you to DC 6 flat{12} if you're hidden.
