# Deadly Poison Weapon
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your poisons are devastatingly potent. When you apply a simple poison with [[Poison Weapon]], the poison deals 4d4 poison damage instead of 1d4 poison damage.

When you apply an injury poison to your weapon, the DC to resist that poison increases by 2, to a maximum of your class DC.
