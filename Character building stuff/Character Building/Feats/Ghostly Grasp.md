# Ghostly Grasp
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your control over your ghostly form grows. You gain the [[Advanced Undead Benefits]] and can interact with physical objects, with limits. You can attempt Strength-based skill checks against physical creatures and objects. You can Interact with physical objects, but the action has no effect unless you succeed at a DC 20 athletics check.
