# Fading
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Frequency** Once per Crimson Shroud.

**Trigger** You are targeted with a Strike by someone you can detect while your Crimson Shroud is active.

* * *

You fade partially from reality. The attacker must attempt a DC 11 flat; on a failure, the attack passes harmlessly through the image of your body that remains behind. An instant later you return to reality, and your Crimson Shroud ends.
