# Impervious Vehicle
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

From armor plating and flexible components, to reinforced materials and backup redundant functionality, you have built safeguards to protect your vehicle from the rigors of combat. Your signature vehicle gains a +1 circumstance bonus to AC and Fortitude saves, and increases its Hit Points by an amount equal to twice your level.
