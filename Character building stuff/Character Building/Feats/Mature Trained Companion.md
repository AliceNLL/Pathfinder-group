# Mature Trained Companion
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your animal companion grows up, becoming a mature animal companion. Increase its proficiency rank in Performance to expert instead of one of the three skill increases for mature. It gains the [[Mesmerizing Performance]] advanced maneuver, rather than the normal advanced maneuver for its type.
