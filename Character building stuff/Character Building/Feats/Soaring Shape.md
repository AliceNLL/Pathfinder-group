# Soaring Shape
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Wings free you from the shackles of the ground below. Add the bat and bird shapes in [[Aerial Form]] to your [[Untamed Form]] list. If you have [[Insect Shape]], you also add the wasp shape to your _untamed form_ list. If you have [[Ferocious Shape]], you also add the pterosaur shape to your _untamed form_ list. Whenever you use _untamed form_ to take a shape that grants you a specific Acrobatics modifier, you gain a +1 status bonus to Acrobatics checks.
