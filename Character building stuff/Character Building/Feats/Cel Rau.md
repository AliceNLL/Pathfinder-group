# Cel Rau
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You are a cel rau, child of a strigoi, one of the first vampires to walk Golarion. Your heritage ties you to the Shadow Plane and grants you strange resilience to light and darkness alike.

You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against effects with the darkness, light, or shadow traits, and whenever you become [[Dazzled]] or [[Blinded]] for at least 2 rounds, you can reduce the duration by 1 round.
