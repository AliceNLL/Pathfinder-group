# Death's Drums
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your life has been spent challenging death itself, and proximity to that implacable foe only makes your heart beat harder.

When you are taking persistent damage or your [[Wounded]] value is 1 or greater, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Fortitude saving throws.
