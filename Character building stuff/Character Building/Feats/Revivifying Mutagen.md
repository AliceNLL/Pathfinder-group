# Revivifying Mutagen
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

While under the effect of a mutagen, you can metabolize that mutagen's power to heal yourself.

This uses a single action, which has the concentrate and manipulate traits.

Once the action is complete, you regain `dice: 1d6` Hit Points for every 2 item levels of the mutagen (minimum 1d6), but the mutagen's duration immediately ends, even if you are under the effect of Persistent Mutagen.
