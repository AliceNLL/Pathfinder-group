# Ember's Eyes
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your eyes blaze with inner flame. You gain [[Low-Light Vision]], or you gain [[Darkvision]] if your ancestry already has low-light vision.

* * *

**Special** If your ancestry has neither low-light vision nor darkvision, you can take this ancestry feat a second time to gain darkvision. You can't retrain out of this feat.
