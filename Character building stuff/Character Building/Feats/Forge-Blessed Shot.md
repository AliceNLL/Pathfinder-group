![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Access** You are from Dongun Hold or Alkenstar.

**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** You attempt a ranged Strike.

* * *

You intone a prayer to the dwarven deities Torag or Angradd, willing a higher power to guide your aim in the heat of battle. On your next Strike with a ranged weapon before the end of your turn, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your attack roll and ignore your target's [[Concealed]] condition, as well as your target's lesser, standard, and greater cover.
