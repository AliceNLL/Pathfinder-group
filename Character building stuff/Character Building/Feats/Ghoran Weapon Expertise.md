# Ghoran Weapon Expertise
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

It's as if you've been training for a thousand years. Whenever you gain a class feature that grants you expert or greater proficiency in a given weapon or weapons, you also gain that proficiency in the glaive, greatclub, hatchet, scythe, sickle, and ghoran weapons in which you're trained.
