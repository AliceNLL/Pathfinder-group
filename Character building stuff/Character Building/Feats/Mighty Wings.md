# Mighty Wings
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your dragon wings are now a permanent part of your body, giving you a fly Speed equal to your Speed. If you spend 1 Focus Point to cast _[[Dragon Wings]]_, your fly Speed increases to 90 feet for the duration, unless your Speed is faster, and you gain the effects of _[[Dragon Claws]]_ for the duration.
