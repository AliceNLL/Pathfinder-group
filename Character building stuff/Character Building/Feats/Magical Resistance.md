# Magical Resistance
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your animating magic provides some defense. Choose one of the following energy damage types: cold, electricity, or sonic. You gain resistance 5 to that damage type.

**Enhancement** You tap deeper into your animating magic, and your resistances improve. Choose one of the following benefits: you gain resistance 5 to the remaining two damage types from the above list, or your chosen resistance increases to a value equal to 1 + half your level.
