# Elemental Explosion
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** You're raging, and you haven't used this ability since you last Raged.

* * *

You unleash the energy roiling within you, exploding elemental matter in a 15 foot emanation. Each creature in the area takes leveled damage, with the same type you chose for elemental rage. Each creature in the area must attempt a DC resolve reflex. Elemental Explosion gains the trait of your element.
