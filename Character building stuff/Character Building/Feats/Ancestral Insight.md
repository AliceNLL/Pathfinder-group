# Ancestral Insight
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You have extensive knowledge of your ancestors' ancient origins. You gain the trained proficiency rank in Alghollthu Lore and Azlanti Lore. If you roll a critical failure on an Alghollthu Lore or Azlanti Lore check to Recall Knowledge, you get a failure instead.
