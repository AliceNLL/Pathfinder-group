# Devil's Advocate
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Access** Chelaxian nationality

You know more about the habits of devils than is entirely safe. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks against devils and saving throws against their abilities.

In addition, whenever you meet a devil in a social situation, you can immediately attempt a Diplomacy check to Make an Impression on that creature rather than needing to converse for 1 minute. You take a -5 penalty to the check. If you fail, you can engage in 1 minute of conversation and attempt a new check at the end of that time rather than accepting the failure or critical failure result.

**Special** If you have the [[Glad-Hand]] skill feat, you don't take the penalty to your immediate Diplomacy check if the target is a devil.
