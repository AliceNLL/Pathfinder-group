# Numb
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

As your body continues to rot and putrefy, your senses deaden and your undead powers grow. You gain the [[Advanced Undead Benefits]] as well as a +1 circumstance bonus on saving throws against emotion and pain effects. While your body is , your numbness amplifies in two ways: the circumstance bonus from this feat increases to +2, and if you roll a success on a saving throw against an emotion or pain effect, you get a critical success instead.
