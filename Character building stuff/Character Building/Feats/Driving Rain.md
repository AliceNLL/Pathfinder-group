# Driving Rain
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Heavy drops of rain batter down, hitting like sling stones and impeding vision. Each creature in a 15 foot burst within 120 feet takes 3d8 bludgeoning  damage with a DC resolve reflex save against your class DC. Until the start of your next turn, all creatures are [[Concealed]] while in the area, and all creatures outside the area are concealed to creatures within it.

* * *

**Level (+2)** The damage increases by 1d8.
