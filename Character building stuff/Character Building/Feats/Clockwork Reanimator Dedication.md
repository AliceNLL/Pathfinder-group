# Clockwork Reanimator Dedication
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You can animate corpses through cunning engineering. You gain a prototype construct companion to serve as a minion. Unlike normal construct companions, yours is a corpse animated by clockwork gears and technological prowess.

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two other feats from the [[Clockwork Reanimator]] archetype. If you retrain out of this feat, you lose the rituals learned from it.
