# Winter Sleet
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Bone-chilling, swirling sleet surrounds you, cruel as deepest winter. Surfaces in your kinetic aura are coated in slippery ice. A creature that moves on this uneven ground immediately falls unless it [[Balance|Balances]] (DC 15). A creature is [[Off-Guard]] on the ice, as normal for uneven ground. You're immune to these effects.

If a creature on the ice is critically hit by one of your water impulses or critically fails at a save against one, that creature is [[Slowed]] until the end of its next turn.
