# Surreptitious Spellcaster
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You've learned that it pays for a Pathfinder to be able to cast spells without being noticed. You gain the [[Conceal Spell]] wizard class feat, though it's not a wizard feat for you. You also gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Stealth checks to Conceal a Spell and to Deception checks to conceal verbal components.
