# Ranged Combatant
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Spines, flame jets, and holy blasts are just some of the ways your eidolon might strike from a distance. It gains a ranged unarmed attack with a range increment of 30 feet that deals 1d4 damage and has the magical and propulsive traits.

When you select this feat, choose a damage type: acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, piercing, slashing, vitality, or void. If your eidolon is a celestial, fiend, or monitor with an alignment other than true neutral, you can choose a damage type in its alignment.
