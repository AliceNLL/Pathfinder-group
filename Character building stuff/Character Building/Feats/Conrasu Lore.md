# Conrasu Lore
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You have learned about your history and your people from shapers. You gain the trained proficiency rank in Crafting and Occultism. If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in Conrasu Lore.

_Note: If you are already trained in the skill provided by this feat, you need to manually select an alternative skill. You also need to manually enter the granted Lore skill._
