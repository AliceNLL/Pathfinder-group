# Slice and Swipe
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Access** Help either the Washboard Dogs or the Diobel Sweepers destroy their rival.

**Requirements** You're wielding a melee weapon that deals slashing damage and you have a free hand.

* * *

You attempt a melee Strike with the required weapon. If you hit and deal damage and the result of your attack roll exceeds the target's Perception DC, you [[Steal]] a small object from the target (as if you had succeeded at that task using the Thievery skill). Depending on the object, the target might realize that it has been stolen, and onlookers might realize you have stolen the object if the attack roll doesn't exceed their Perception DCs.
