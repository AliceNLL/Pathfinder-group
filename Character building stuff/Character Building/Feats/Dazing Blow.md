**Requirements** You have a creature [[Grabbed]].

* * *

You pummel a held foe, hoping to stagger them. Make a melee Strike against a creature you have grabbed. The weapon damage from this Strike is bludgeoning damage. If the Strike hits, the creature must attempt a DC resolve fortitude save against your class DC; this is an incapacitation effect.

* * *

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature is [[Stunned 1]].

**Failure** The creature is [[Stunned 1|Stunned 2]].

**Critical Failure** The creature is [[Stunned 1|Stunned 3]].
