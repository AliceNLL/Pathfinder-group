# Straveika
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You descend from one of the truly ancient vampires, a nosferatu cursed to eternal life but not eternal youth. People call you straveika, or ancient-born. The vestiges of your forebear's powers of domination have left you with an understanding of how a creature's intentions change its behaviors. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Perception checks to [[Sense Motive]] and Perception DCs against attempts to [[Lie]] to you.
