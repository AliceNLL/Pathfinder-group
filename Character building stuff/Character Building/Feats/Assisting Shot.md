# Assisting Shot
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** You are wielding a ranged weapon.

* * *

Using your last shot to gauge your accuracy, you can fire off a quick shot to interfere with a foe in combat. Make a Strike with a ranged weapon. If the Strike hits, the next creature other than you to attack the same target before the start of your next turn gains a +1 circumstance bonus to their roll, or a +2 circumstance bonus if your Strike was a critical hit.
