# Rat Magic
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

There always seems to be a little rat around to carry messages for you. You can cast _[[Animal Messenger]]_ once per day as a primal innate spell. When you do, the animal that responds is always a rat. If there are no rats within range, the spell is lost.
