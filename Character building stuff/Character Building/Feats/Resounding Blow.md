# Resounding Blow
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** You are wielding a melee weapon that deals bludgeoning damage.

* * *

You strike your enemy in the head with such force that their ears ring. Make a melee Strike. If the Strike hits and deals damage, the target is [[Deafened]] until the start of your next turn (or for 1 minute on a critical hit).
