**Trigger** You destroy an undead foe.

You defy Tar-Baphon with every undead you destroy, using your victory to rally your allies. Allies that can see you gain a +1 status bonus to attack and damage rolls against undead for 1 round, or a +2 status bonus to attack and damage rolls against undead for 2 rounds if the undead foe destroyed was a creature of your level or higher.
