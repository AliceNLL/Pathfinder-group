# Interweave Dispel
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You weave dispelling energy into a spell, sending both effects at a foe.

If your next action is to cast a single-target spell against a creature, and you either hit the foe with the spell attack roll or the foe fails its saving throw, you can cast _[[Dispel Magic]]_ on the foe as a free action, expending a spell slot as normal and targeting one spell effect affecting the foe.
