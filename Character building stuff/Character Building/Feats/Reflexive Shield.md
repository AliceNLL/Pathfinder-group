# Reflexive Shield
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You can use your shield to fend off explosions and the like. When you [[Raise a Shield|Raise your Shield]], you gain your shield's circumstance bonus to Reflex saves.

* * *

**Special** If you have the [[Shield Block]] reaction, damage you take as a result of a Reflex save can trigger that reaction, even if the damage isn't physical damage.
