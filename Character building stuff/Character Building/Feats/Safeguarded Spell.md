# Safeguarded Spell
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You bring the magical wavelengths of your spell into sync with the ones produced by your own body. If the next action you take is to [[Cast a Spell]] with an area, you aren't affected by the spell even if you are within the area.
