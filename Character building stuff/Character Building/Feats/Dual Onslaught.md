# Dual Onslaught
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

When you lash out with both weapons, you leave no room for the target to escape your attack.

When you use [[Double Slice]], if you miss with both [[Strike|Strikes]], choose one of the two weapons and apply the effects of a hit with that weapon.

You can't choose a weapon if your attack roll with that weapon was a critical failure, meaning you still miss entirely if both attack rolls were critical failures.
