# Stonewall
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** An enemy or hazard's effect hits you or you fail a Fortitude save against one.

* * *

The strength of stone overcomes you so strongly that it replaces your stout body. You become [[Petrified]] until the end of the current turn. You don't take any damage from the triggering effect or any other ill effects that couldn't affect stone.
