# Rescuer's Press
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Any shield you wield gains the shove trait. When you [[Shove]] using a shield and Stride as part of that action, you can move an additional 5 feet to either side of the creature you Shoved. In addition, if you are in the [[Everstand Stance]] and successfully Shove a creature using a shield that you wield two-handed, you can increase the distance of your Shove to 10 feet.
