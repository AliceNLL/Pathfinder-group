# Spark of Independence
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You touch a creature with the minion trait and share the heightened sense of autonomy you've discovered. The minion is [[Quickened]] for 1 round and is then temporarily immune for 10 minutes. It can use this extra action to Step, Stride, or Strike.
