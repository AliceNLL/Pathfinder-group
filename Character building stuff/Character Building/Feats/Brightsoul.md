# Brightsoul
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

The fire inside you asserts itself as beaming, radiant light. Your body is naturally luminescent, glowing with the effects of a primal _[[Light]]_ cantrip. A cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up. The light is involuntary and constant; if counteracted, it returns in `dice: 1d4` rounds. You suffer a -2 circumstance penalty on Stealth checks to Hide or Sneak and gain a +1 circumstance bonus on saves against light effects and effects that inflict the [[Blinded]] or [[Dazzled]] conditions.
