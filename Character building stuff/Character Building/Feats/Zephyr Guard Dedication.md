# Zephyr Guard Dedication
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

As a Zephyr Guard, you're always vigilant against crime and threats to the city's safety. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Perception checks against attempts to Palm an Object, Steal, or Conceal an Object (including you're Seeking concealed objects). You become trained in Society and Katapesh Lore; if you were already trained, you become an expert instead.

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the [[Zephyr Guard]] archetype.
