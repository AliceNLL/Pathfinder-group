# Primal Rampage
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You tap into the unstoppable, primeval strength of your ancient kin. You gain _[[Unfettered Movement]]_ and _[[Mountain Resilience]]_ as 4th-level primal innate spells that you can cast once per day. As a 3-action activity, you can Cast a Spell twice to cast both of these innate spells, as long as they are both still available for the day.
