**Requirements** You are wielding a melee weapon.

Your body coiled to strike, you can lash out at distant enemies. While you are in this stance, you can use Reactive Strike against a creature that is outside your reach but within the reach you would have with a Lunge. If you do, you increase your range with the Strike by 5 feet.
