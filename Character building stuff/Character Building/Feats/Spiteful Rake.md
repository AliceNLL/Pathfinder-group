# Spiteful Rake
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** You have both hands free.

* * *

Your instincts sing of spite and malice, and you've learned a devastating trick: go for the eyes. You make a claw Strike. If you hit and deal damage, the target is [[Dazzled]] for 1 round. On a critical hit, the target is instead [[Blinded]] for 1 round and dazzled until restored to maximum hit points.
