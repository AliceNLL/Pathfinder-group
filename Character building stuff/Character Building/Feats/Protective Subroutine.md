# Protective Subroutine
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your nanites can augment your defenses. You can choose to activate [[Nanite Surge]] when you attempt a saving throw, instead of when you attempt a skill check. If you do, you gain a +2 status bonus to the triggering saving throw.
