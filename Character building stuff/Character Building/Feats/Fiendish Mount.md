# Fiendish Mount
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your steed ally manifests a suite of powerful and sinister gifts granted to it by your deity.

It gains [[Darkvision]], its maximum Hit Points increase by 40, and it gains weakness 10 to holy damage.

Additionally, it grows wings appropriate for a servitor of your deity (such as bat wings for a devil), granting it a [[Fly]] Speed equal to its Speed.

It gains the fiend trait and the trait appropriate to the type of servitor it has become (such as daemon, demon, or devil).
