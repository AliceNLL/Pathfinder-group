**Trigger** A creature or hazard would deal sonic damage to you.

* * *

You can manipulate the acoustics around you to deflect sonic damage back at its source. Attempt a Performance check against the performance{Will DC} of the creature or performance{Fortitude DC} of a hazard. If the damage came from a spell, use the creature's spell DC if it's lower.

* * *

**Critical Success** You reduce the triggering damage by an amount up to four times your level. The creature takes sonic damage equal to the amount of damage you reduced in this way.

**Success** As critical success, but you reduce the triggering damage by an amount up to twice your level.
