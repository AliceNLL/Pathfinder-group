# Diverting Vortex
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** Your most recent action was to cast a non-cantrip spell.

* * *

You transfer vestiges of magical energy to the air around you, creating a vortex that deflects ranged attacks. Until the start of your next turn, you gain a +1 status bonus to AC against ranged weapon attacks and physical ranged unarmed attacks.
