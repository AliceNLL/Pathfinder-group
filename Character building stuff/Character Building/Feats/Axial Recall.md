# Axial Recall
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You have reconfigured the magical resonance of your core to attune to the planar energies of Axis. You can cast _[[Interplanar Teleport]]_ twice per week as an arcane innate spell that can only target yourself; you can travel only to Axis or the Material Plane, and your body serves as the focus component.
