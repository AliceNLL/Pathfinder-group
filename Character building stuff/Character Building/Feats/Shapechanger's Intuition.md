# Shapechanger's Intuition
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

A lifetime of experience helps you see through disguises. When you come within 10 feet of a creature that is transformed into another form or is Impersonating a specific creature, the GM rolls a secret Perception check for you to realize that the creature is transformed, even if you didn't spend an action to Seek against that creature.
