# Discerning Strike
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** You have successfully identified the target with Recall Knowledge during this combat.

* * *

Identifying a creature is the first step in finding its weaknesses. Attempt a Strike against the target; if successful, you deal an additional 1d6 precision damage. If you have succeeded on a Recall Knowledge check against the target during this combat and their creature type was previously recorded using [[Thorough Reports]], you also deal 1 bleed damage. The creature is then temporarily immune to Discerning Strike for 1 day.
