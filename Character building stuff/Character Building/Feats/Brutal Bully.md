# Brutal Bully
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You push your foes around and leave bruises. While raging, when you successfully Disarm, Grapple, Shove, or Trip a foe, you deal that foe bludgeoning damage equal to your Strength modifier; add this to the damage from a critical success to Trip.
