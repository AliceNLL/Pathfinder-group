# Scoundrel's Surprise
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You drop your disguise at the right moment and surprise your target. After you [[Impersonate]] someone else using a disguise kit, you can remove your disguise with a dramatic gesture. Any creatures that previously failed to see through your disguise are [[Off-Guard]] against the next attack you make before the end of your turn.
