# See the Unseen
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You notice things that others can't see at all. While you're adjacent to an [[Undetected]] creature of your level or lower, it is instead only [[Hidden]] from you. You only need a successful DC 5 flat to target a hidden creature.
