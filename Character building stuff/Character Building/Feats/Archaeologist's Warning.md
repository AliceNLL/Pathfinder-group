# Archaeologist's Warning
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** You are about to roll a Perception, Society, or Thievery check for initiative.

* * *

You visually or audibly warn your companions of danger, granting them a +1 circumstance bonus to their initiative rolls. Depending on whether you use gestures or call out, this free action gains either the visual or auditory trait.
