# Harrow Ritualist
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You immediately learn two of the following rituals: _[[Astral Projection]]_, _[[Call Spirit]]_, _[[Commune]]_, _[[Commune]]_, _[[Collective Memories]]_, or _[[Binding Circle]]_. When you perform any ritual, you can incorporate harrow cards into the ritual to gain a +2 status bonus to all skill checks made to resolve the effects of the ritual. You can take this feat more than once; each time you do, you learn two new rituals.
