# Acrobat Dedication
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You become an expert in Acrobatics. At 7th level, you become a master in Acrobatics, and at 15th level, you become legendary in Acrobatics.

Whenever you critically succeed at an Acrobatics check to [[Tumble Through]] an enemy's space, you don't treat the enemy's space as difficult terrain.

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the [[Acrobat]] archetype.
