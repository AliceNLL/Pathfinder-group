# Nagaji Lore
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You're the vassal or apprentice of a learned naga, and you've studied the secrets of naga magic and concocting intricate poisons. You gain the trained proficiency rank in Crafting and Occultism. If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in your choice of Nagaji Lore or Naga Lore.
