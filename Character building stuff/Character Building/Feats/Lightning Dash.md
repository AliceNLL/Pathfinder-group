# Lightning Dash
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

For an instant, you transform yourself into a being of pure lightning and fly forward, shocking anyone in your way. You propel yourself forward in a 30 foot line. You can move through creatures during this movement, and this movement doesn't trigger reactions that are triggered by movement. Each creature you move through takes 2d12 electricity  damage with a DC resolve reflex save against your class DC. You return to your normal form in the final square of the line. If you're in the air, you fall unless you have a fly Speed.

* * *

**Level (+3)** The length of the line increases by 5 feet, and the damage increases by 1d12.
