# Paragon's Guard
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** You are wielding a shield.

* * *

Once you've had a moment to set your stance, you always have your shield ready without a thought. While you are in this stance, you constantly have your shield raised as if you'd used the [[Raise a Shield]] action.
