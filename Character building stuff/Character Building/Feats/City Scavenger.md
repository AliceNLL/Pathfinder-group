# City Scavenger
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You know that the greatest treasures often look like refuse. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to checks to Subsist, and you can use Society or Survival when you [[Subsist]] in a settlement.

When you Subsist in a city, you also gather valuable junk that silly longshanks threw away. You can [[Earn Income]] using Society or Survival at the same time while you Subsist, without spending any additional days of downtime. You also gain a +1 circumstance bonus to this check.

* * *

**Special** If you have the irongut goblin heritage, increase the bonuses to +2.
