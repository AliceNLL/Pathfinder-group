# Celestial Magic
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You possess celestial magic. Choose two of the following spells: _[[Clear Mind]]_, _[[Everlight]]_, _[[Humanoid Form]]_, _[[Revealing Light]]_, _[[Share Life]]_, or _[[Sure Footing]]_. You can use each of the chosen spells once per day as 2nd-rank divine innate spells.

Angelkin typically take clear mind and humanoid form, lawbringers typically have everlight and share life, and musetouched typically have revealing light and sure footing.
