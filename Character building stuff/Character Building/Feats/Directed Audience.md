# Directed Audience
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You can shape the area of your composition spells. Whenever you cast a composition spell whose area is an emanation, you can change the spell's area to a cone 10 feet larger, to a maximum of twice the original area. For example, you could modify a composition spell that affects a 30 foot emanation to affect a 40 foot cone, but a 5 foot emanation could only become a 10 foot cone.
