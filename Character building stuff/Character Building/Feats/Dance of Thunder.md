# Dance of Thunder
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Frequency** once per minute

**Requirements** You're wielding a loaded firearm or crossbow and are not [[Fatigued]].

* * *

Your steps echo with the thunderous retort of exploding black powder as you dance a dance of death. Take any of the following actions you choose in any order: Step, Strike against a target within your firearm's first range increment, and Interact to reload. If you attempted a Strike and it succeeded, you can repeat these three actions again in any order. If you attempted a Strike in the second set and succeeded, you can repeat the actions one last time.

After using Dance of Thunder, you become fatigued for 1 minute.
