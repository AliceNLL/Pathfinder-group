# Spellmaster Dedication
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

As a Spellmaster, you are adept at identifying magic. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus when you [[Identify Magic]] with a skill in which you are trained or better. If you have the [[Wayfinder Resonance Tinkerer]] feat, you can change the cantrip you chose for that feat each day during your daily preparations.

* * *

**Special** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the [[Spellmaster]] archetype.
