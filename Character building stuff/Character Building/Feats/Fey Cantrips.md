# Fey Cantrips
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You've learned the cantrips sprites have used since time immemorial. You gain _[[Light]]_ and _[[Ghost Sound]]_ as primal innate cantrips. If you have the grig heritage, you also gain _[[Detect Magic]]_, and if you have the draxie heritage, you gain _[[Prestidigitation]]_.
