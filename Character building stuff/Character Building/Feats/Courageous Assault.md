# Courageous Assault
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

With a mighty shout, you can stir an ally to attack. If your next action is to cast the [[Courageous Anthem]] composition cantrip, one ally of your choice who gains a status bonus from the spell can immediately use their reaction to make a melee Strike.
