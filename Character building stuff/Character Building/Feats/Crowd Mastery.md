# Crowd Mastery
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You use the crowd to your advantage, diverting your foes' attention to potential hidden dangers in the crowd. When determining if your foe is flanked, treat all squares occupied by a crowd as if they were occupied by an ally with a melee reach of 5 feet.
