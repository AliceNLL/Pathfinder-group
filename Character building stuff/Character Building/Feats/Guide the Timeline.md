# Guide the Timeline
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

You know the result you want and subtly nudge the timeline to your intended destination. Choose an ally or a foe. If you choose an ally, the next time within the next round that ally makes an attack roll or skill check, they roll it twice and take the higher result; this is a fortune effect. If you choose a foe, the next time within the next round that foe makes an attack roll or skill check, they must roll twice and take the lower result unless they succeed at a Will save against your chronoskimmer DC; this is a misfortune effect. Regardless of your choice, the target becomes temporarily immune for 24 hours.
