# Barbarian Dedication
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You become trained in Athletics; if you were already trained in Athletics, you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You become trained in barbarian class DC. You can use the [[Rage]] action. Choose an [[Instinct]] as you would if you were a barbarian. You have that instinct for all purposes and become bound by its anathema, but you don't gain any of the other abilities it grants.

* * *

**Special** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the [[Barbarian]] archetype.
