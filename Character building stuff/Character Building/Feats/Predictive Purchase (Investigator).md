# Predictive Purchase (Investigator)
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You have just the thing for the situation. You gain the [[Prescient Planner]] and [[Prescient Consumable]] feats.

When using Prescient Planner, you can pull out the item as a 2-action activity to remove your backpack (or a similar container) and draw the item, rather than taking 1 minute.
