# Blazing Wave
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Flames flow out of you in a cascade, engulfing everyone in a 30 foot cone. Each creature in the area takes 4d6 fire  damage with a DC resolve reflex save against your class DC. A creature that critically fails its save is knocked [[Prone]].

* * *

**Level (+2)** The damage increases by 1d6.
