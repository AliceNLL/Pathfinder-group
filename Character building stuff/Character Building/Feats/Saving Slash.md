# Saving Slash
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** An opponent critically hits you with a melee attack.

* * *

You quickly whirl your blade, trying to deflect enough momentum to avoid the worst of the attack. Attempt a DC 16 flat. If you succeed, the attack becomes a normal hit, instead of a critical hit.
