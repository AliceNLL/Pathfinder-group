# Discerning Gaze
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You have a sense for when people are lying. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus on your secret Perception checks to Sense Motive.

If you use Sense Motive on a creature you have currently condemned with Harsh Judgment, your GM rolls the Perception check twice and takes the higher result (this is a fortune effect).
