![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your connection to both life and undeath lets you twist the healing power of magic items to suit your own needs and aims. Whenever you Activate an Item to cast a _[[Heal]]_ spell, you can invert its energy to produce the effects of an equivalent _[[Harm]]_ spell instead.
