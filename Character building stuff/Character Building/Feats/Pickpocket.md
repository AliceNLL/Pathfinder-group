# Pickpocket
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You can [[Steal]] or [[Palm an Object]] that's closely guarded, such as in a pocket, without taking the –5 penalty. You can't steal objects that would be extremely noticeable or time consuming to remove (like worn shoes or armor or actively wielded objects). If you're a master in Thievery, you can attempt to Steal from a creature in combat or otherwise on guard. When doing so, Stealing requires 2 actions instead of 1, and you take a –5 penalty.
