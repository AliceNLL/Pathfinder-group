# Sense Evil
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You sense evil as a queasy or foreboding feeling. You detect unholy creatures as a vague sense, similar to humans' sense of smell. An unholy creature using a disguise or otherwise trying to hide its presence attempts a Deception check against your Perception DC to hide its unholiness from you. If the creature succeeds at its Deception check, it is then temporarily immune to your Sense Evil for 1 day.
