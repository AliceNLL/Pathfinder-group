# Embodied Dragoon Subjectivity
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

When your allies call for swift reinforcements or lightning raids, you're ready to answer. Your titanic form encompasses both cavalry and rider so that you're able to traverse vast distances and exploit opportunities in the theater of war. Your pores distend and extrude copious amounts of blood, subcutaneous fat, and lymphatic fluid for you to harden and flash-sculpt into gliding wings or a swift-hurtling mount. You can cast _feather fall_ and _phantom steed_ each once per day as innate occult spells. When you cast _feather fall_ in this way, gliding wings slow your fall, and when you cast _phantom steed_ in this way, the steed physically protrudes from your own lower body. Neither of these cosmetic changes alter the spells' effects; for example, foes can still attack the _phantom steed_ as normal.
