# Gaping Flesh
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** A creature you are aware of damages you with a melee Strike.

* * *

Your wound yawns open, appalling your attacker. The attacker must succeed at a DC resolve fortitude saving throw against your class or spell DC, whichever is higher, or become [[Sickened 1]] ([[Sickened 1|Sickened 2]] on a critical failure). It can't recover from the sickened condition while it's adjacent to you.
