# Fang Sharpener
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You have filed your teeth into jagged points and have an unusually powerful jaw, making your mouth a dangerous weapon. If you're an irongut goblin, you gain a jaws unarmed attack that deals 1d4 piercing damage, and if you're a razortooth goblin, your jaws unarmed attack deals 1d8 piercing damage and loses the finesse trait. Whenever you score a critical hit with your jaws unarmed attack, your target takes 1 bleed damage per weapon damage die.
