# Shared Stratagem
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

The plans you make include your allies as well as yourself. When you hit a creature with an attack on which you substituted your attack roll due to [[Devise a Stratagem|Devise a Strategem]], designate one ally.

The creature you hit is [[Off-Guard]] to that ally on the next attack the designated ally makes against that creature before the start of your next turn.
