# Seedpod
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your body produces a nearly endless supply of hard seedpods. You gain a seedpod ranged unarmed attack with a range increment of 30 feet that deals 1d4 bludgeoning damage. On a critical hit, a seedpod bursts, issuing forth a tangle of vegetation that imposes a â€“10-foot circumstance penalty on the target's Speed until the start of your next turn. Seedpods do not add critical specialization effects.
