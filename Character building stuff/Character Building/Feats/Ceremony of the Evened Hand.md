# Ceremony of the Evened Hand
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You have cultivated your exoskeleton's form for close combat, using knots, whorls, and reinforced branches. When you select this feat, you gain a claws unarmed attack that deals 1d4 slashing damage and has the agile and finesse traits or a branch unarmed attack that deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage and has the backswing trait. Each of these unarmed attacks is in the brawling weapon group and uses one of your hands.

**Special** You can select this feat twice, choosing the other unarmed attack the second time you take it.
