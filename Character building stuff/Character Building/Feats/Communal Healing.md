# Communal Healing
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You're an exceptional conduit for vitality and, as you channel it through you, you can divert some to heal yourself or another creature. When you cast the [[Heal]] spell to heal a single creature, choose another willing living creature within range of your _heal_ to regain Hit Points equal to the _heal_ spell's rank.
