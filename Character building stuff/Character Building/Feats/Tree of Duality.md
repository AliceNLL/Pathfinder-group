# Tree of Duality
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

An ephemeral tree bursts forth, floating on air in an unoccupied square of your choice within 60 feet. Blooming flowers and fungal growths shed pollen and spores, which a swirling gust of air spreads in a 10 foot emanation around it. The tree lasts until the end of your next turn, and you can Sustain it up to 1 minute.

*   **Cleansing Pollen** (healing, vitality) Each living ally that's in the area or enters it regains 3d4 HP and is then temporarily immune to regaining HP from Tree of Duality for 10 minutes.
*   **Hallucinogenic Spores** (mental) Enemies in the area are [[Dazzled]]. An enemy that leaves the area remains dazzled until the start of its next turn.

* * *

**Level (+2)** The healing increases by 1d4.
