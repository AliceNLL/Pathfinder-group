# Great Cleave
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your fury carries your weapon through multiple foes. When you [[Cleave]], if your Strike also kills or knocks the target unconscious, you can continue to make melee Strikes until you make a Strike that doesn't kill or knock a creature unconscious, or until there are no creatures adjacent to the most recent creature you attacked while Cleaving, whichever comes first.
