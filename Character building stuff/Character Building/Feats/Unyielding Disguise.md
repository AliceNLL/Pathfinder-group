# Unyielding Disguise
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

When you cast _[[Humanoid Form]]_ or _[[Illusory Disguise]]_ to alter your appearance, the spell's duration is 2 hours. At the end of the duration, you can extend the spell's duration for another hour, but doing so is taxing, making you [[Drained 1]]. You can keep extending it in this way, increasing your drained condition by 1 each time, to a maximum duration of 6 hours.
