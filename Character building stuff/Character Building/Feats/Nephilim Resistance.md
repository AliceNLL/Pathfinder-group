# Nephilim Resistance
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You resist energy like your extraplanar predecessors. Choose one of the following energy damage types: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. You gain resistance 5 to that damage type.

The damage type typically matches an extraplanar entity associated with your bloodline. For instance, an [[Angelkin]] might choose resistance to cold, while a [[Hellspawn]] might choose resistance to fire.
