# Grovel
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

With obsequious words and begging gestures, you convince your foe you're less of a threat.

You attempt to [[Feint]] against a creature. Unlike a normal Feint, the creature can be within 30 feet instead of in your melee reach, and you make your check against its Will DC instead of its Perception DC.
