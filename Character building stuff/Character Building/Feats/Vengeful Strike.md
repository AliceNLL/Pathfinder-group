# Vengeful Strike
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** A creature within your reach succeeds or critically succeeds at an attack against you.

**Requirements** You're under the effect of [[Come and Get Me]]

* * *

When struck by an enemy, you respond in turn. Make a melee Strike against the triggering creature. This Strike doesn't count toward your multiple attack penalty, and your multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike.
