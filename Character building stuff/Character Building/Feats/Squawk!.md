# Squawk!
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** You critically fail a Deception, Diplomacy, or Intimidation check against a creature that doesn't have the tengu trait.

* * *

You let out an awkward squawk, ruffle your feathers, or fake some other birdlike tic to cover up a social misstep or faux pas. You get a failure on the triggering check, rather than a critical failure. All creatures that witnessed you Squawk are temporarily immune for 24 hours.
