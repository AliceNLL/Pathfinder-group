# Half-Truths
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You are able to weave your words in such a way that you never use actual lies, but still mislead people to certain conclusions. You can attempt to make a [[Request]] of a creature using Deception instead of Diplomacy. You can attempt to [[Lie]] to a creature using Diplomacy instead of Deception. If you fail your check to Lie, the creature realizes that you were twisting words to fool them without outright lying.
