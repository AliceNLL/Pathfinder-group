# Detective's Readiness
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

When you're on a case, you stay watchful and resolute to avoid tricks your suspect might pull.

You gain your circumstance bonus from [[Pursue a Lead]] on saving throws (and their DCs, as normal) against the subject of a lead, and you can use [[Clue In]] to assist an ally's saving throw against that subject.
