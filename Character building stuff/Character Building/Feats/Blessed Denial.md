# Blessed Denial
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** An ally within 30 feet would become [[Frightened]], [[Drained 1|Drained]], [[Enfeebled 1|Enfeebled]], [[Sickened 1|Sickened]], or [[Stupefied]].

* * *

You exude peace and protection, lessening a harmful condition as it falls upon an ally. Reduce the value of the condition your ally would take by 1 (to a minimum of 0). If the ally takes more than one condition at the same time, choose one to reduce.
