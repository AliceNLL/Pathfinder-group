**Frequency** once per day

You summon an aura of swirling wind and lightning.

For 1 minute, you gain [[Concealed|Concealment]] against creatures more than 5 feet away, and any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of you suffers 1d12 electricity damage (DC resolve reflex save using your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher).

At 2d12 electricity{13th} and 3d12 electricity{17th} level, this damage increases by 1d12.
