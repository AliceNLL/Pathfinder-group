# Avatar's Protection
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** You are critically hit by an enemy.

**Requirements** You have an [[Avatar]] spell prepared.

* * *

In moments of danger, you can call upon your god's form in an instant. You cast _avatar_ from your spell slots. The triggering critical hit is reduced to a normal hit, and its damage is applied after gaining the _avatar_ spell's temporary Hit Points.
