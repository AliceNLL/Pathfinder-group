# Fresh Produce
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You grow a nourishing nut, vegetable, seed, or fruit. Choose a creature in your kinetic aura. The produce grows in their open hand, or at their feet if they have no open hands. The produce has light Bulk. A creature can eat it with an Interact action to regain 1d4+1 HP; this is a healing vitality effect. The creature feels full for 10 minutes, during which it has resistance 2 to void damage and can't eat another piece of produce. Produce not consumed by the start of your next turn withers away.

* * *

**Level (+2)** The healing increases by 1d4+5, and the resistance increases by 2.
