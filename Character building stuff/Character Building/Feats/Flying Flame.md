# Flying Flame
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

A Tiny shape of flame appears, taking a form of your choiceâ€”such as a bird, an arrow, or a simple sphere. It Flies from you up to 30 feet in a path you choose. Each creature it passes through takes 1d6 fire  damage with a DC resolve reflex save against your class DC. A creature attempts only one save, even if the flame passes through it multiple times.

* * *

**Level (+2)** The damage increases by 1d6.
