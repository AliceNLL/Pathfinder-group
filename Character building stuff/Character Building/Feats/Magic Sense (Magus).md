# Magic Sense (Magus)
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You have a literal sixth sense for ambient magic in your vicinity.

You can sense the presence of magic auras as though you were always using a 1st-level _[[Detect Magic]]_ spell. This detects magic in your field of vision only.

When you [[Seek]], you gain the benefits of a 3rd-level _detect magic_ spell on things you see (in addition to the normal benefits of Seeking). You can turn this sense off and on with a free action at the start or the end of your turn.
