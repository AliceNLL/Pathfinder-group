# Express Rider
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You know how to encourage your mount to cover ground quickly.

When calculating your travel speed for the day while mounted, you can attempt a Nature check to [[Command an Animal]] to increase your mount's travel speed. The DC is determined by the GM, but is typically based on the mount's level or the difficulty of the environment, whichever is harder.

On a success, increase your mount's travel speed by half. This has no effect on your mount's movement in encounters.
