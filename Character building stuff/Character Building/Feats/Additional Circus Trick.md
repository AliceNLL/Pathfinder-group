# Additional Circus Trick
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your signature trick can have one additional trait beyond the normal number. If the trick trait has an associated skill (such as Intimidation with the fire trait) and that skill is one of your trick checks, your checks with that skill to Perform a Trick aren't penalized if you Perform a Trick using a different skill. For example, if your signature trick has Acrobatics and Intimidation as trick checks and you take this feat to add the fire trait, you can Perform a Trick using Acrobatics (at no penalty), then Acrobatics again (at a -5 penalty), and then Intimidation (at no penalty).
