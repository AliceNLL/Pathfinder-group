# Ornate Tattoo
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You expand your tattoos to encompass greater magic. Choose a 1st-level arcane spell from the same school as your Arcane Tattoos, either a common spell or another to which you have access. You can cast that spell once per day as an innate arcane spell.
