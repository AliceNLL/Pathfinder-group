# Rain of Razors
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Razor-sharp slivers of metal fall from the sky. Each creature in a 20-Foot Burst within 60 feet takes 9d6 slashing damage with a DC 0 Basic Reflex save against your class DC. The razors embed in all surfaces in the area, making them hazardous terrain for 1 minute. A creature that moves through this hazardous terrain takes 3 slashing damage for every square of the area it moves into.

* * *

**Level (+2)** The initial damage increases by 1d6 and the hazardous terrain damage increases by 1.
