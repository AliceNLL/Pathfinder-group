# Follow-up Assault
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** You used your previous action to make a melee Strike that missed.

* * *

Even in the face of failure you press the attack, determined to succeed. Make a Strike with the same weapon, adding the effects of the backswing and forceful weapon traits.
