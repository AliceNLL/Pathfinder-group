# Fighting Horn
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You can modify the size and shape of your horn over time using your mental powers. Choose two of the following weapon traits: disarm, grapple, shove, and trip. Your horn gains the chosen traits.

**Special** You can take this feat a second time, adding the traits you didn't choose when you first took it.
