# Imposing Destrier
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Under your care, your mount has realized its innate potential. The mount you gained through the divine ally class feature is now a nimble or savage animal companion. During an encounter, even if you don't use the Command an Animal action, your mount can still use 1 action on your turn to Stride or Strike.
