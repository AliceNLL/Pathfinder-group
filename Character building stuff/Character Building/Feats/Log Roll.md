# Log Roll

**Requirements** You and an adjacent creature are both on a narrow surface or uneven ground and the other creature is off-guard.

* * *

You shuffle your feet to dislodge the surface beneath you or otherwise cause your opponent to become unsteady. Attempt an acrobatics check against the adjacent creature's Reflex saving throw DC. On a success, the creature falls. On a critical failure, you fall.
