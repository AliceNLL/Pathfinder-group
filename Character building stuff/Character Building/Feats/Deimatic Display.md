# Deimatic Display
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Imitating animal threat displays, you make yourself appear larger and more imposing. Roll one Intimidation check to [[Demoralize]] and compare the result to the Will DC of each animal, fungus, and plant creature in a 15 foot cone. When you do, Demoralize gains the visual trait. You don't take a penalty if the creature doesn't understand your language.
