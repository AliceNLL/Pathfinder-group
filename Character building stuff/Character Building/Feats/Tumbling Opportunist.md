![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Frequency** once per minute

**Requirements** Your most recent action was to [[Tumble Through]] or [[Tumbling Strike]], and you successfully moved through an enemy's space.

* * *

You use a burst of stamina to perform a breathtaking feat of Acrobatics as you speed through a foe's space, leaving your foe lying flat on their back. You attempt to [[Trip]] the enemy whose space you moved through. You can use Acrobatics instead of Athletics for this check.
