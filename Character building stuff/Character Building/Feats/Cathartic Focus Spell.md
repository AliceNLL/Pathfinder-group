# Cathartic Focus Spell
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You learn the focus spell listed under your emotion's entry. You can cast it only while in emotional fervor. If you don't already have one, you gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point, which you can Refocus while you use [[Settle Emotions]].
