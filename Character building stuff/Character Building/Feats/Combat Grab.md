# Combat Grab
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** You have one hand free, and your target is within reach of that hand.

* * *

Using your prior attack to shift your opponent's guard, you take another swing and grab them. Make a melee Strike while keeping one hand free. If the Strike hits, you grab the target using your free hand. The creature remains [[Grabbed]] until the end of your next turn or until it [[Escape|Escapes]], whichever comes first.
