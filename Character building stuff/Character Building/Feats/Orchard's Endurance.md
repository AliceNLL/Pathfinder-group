# Orchard's Endurance
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Patches of bark appear on the skin of you and your nearby allies. You and your allies in your kinetic aura gain resistance 5 to bludgeoning and piercing damage. In addition, you and your affected allies roll flat checks to recover from persistent damage twice and take the higher result; this is a fortune effect.

* * *

**Level (+4)** The resistance increases by 2.
