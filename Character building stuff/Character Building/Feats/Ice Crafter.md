# Ice Crafter
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

The ancient ice-crafting techniques of the saumen kar awaken within you. You become trained in Crafting, or become an expert if you were already trained. You gain the [[Magical Crafting]] skill feat. You can craft permanent items out of ice instead of metal or wood; these items are a translucent crystal-blue in color, resemble icicles and glacier ice, and have the same statistics and properties as cold iron, including the price and the ability to deal additional damage to certain kinds of creatures. Any creature who wields or wears a piece of ice-crafted equipment takes 1 cold damage each round from contact with the primal cold of the crafted ice.
