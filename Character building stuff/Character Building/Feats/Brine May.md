# Brine May
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your mother was a sea hag, granting you one sea-green or blue eye. You find comfort both in the sea and on the shore. Whenever you roll a success on an Athletics check to [[Swim]], you get a critical success instead. If you end your turn in water without having succeeded at a Swim action that round, you don't sink (but you might still be moved by the current).
