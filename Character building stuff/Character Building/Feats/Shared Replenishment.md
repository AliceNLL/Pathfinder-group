# Shared Replenishment
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

When your deity blesses your warlike acts, you can extend that favor to your allies. You can grant the temporary Hit Points from [[Replenishment of War]] to an ally within 10 feet instead of gaining them yourself. You can grant these temporary Hit Points to a different ally each time, meaning you might be able to grant them to multiple creatures in a single turn.
