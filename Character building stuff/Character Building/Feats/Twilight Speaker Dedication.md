# Twilight Speaker Dedication
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You have carefully studied the histories, customs, and etiquette of many of the younger peoples of Golarion. You become an expert in Society. At 7th level, you become a master in Society, and at 15th level, you become legendary in Society. You can use the Society skill instead of the Diplomacy skill when you attempt to [[Make an Impression]] on a non-elven intelligent humanoid creature.

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two other feats from the [[Twilight Speaker]] archetype.
