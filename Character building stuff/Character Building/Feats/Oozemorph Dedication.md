# Oozemorph Dedication
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You are plagued by sporadic anatomical rearrangements, which grant you insights into other creatures with unusual anatomies. You become trained in Occultism and Ooze Lore; if you were already trained, you become an expert instead. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Reflex saves to avoid being Engulfed by creatures, and to checks to [[Escape]] after being Engulfed.

As you develop more abilities based on your amorphous affliction, you become increasingly off-putting to mundane creatures. You take a penalty to Diplomacy checks against animals and humanoids. This penalty is equal to your number of class feats from the oozemorph archetype, to a maximum of -4 for four or more feats.

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the [[Oozemorph]] archetype.
