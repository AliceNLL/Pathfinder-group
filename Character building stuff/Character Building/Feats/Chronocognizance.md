# Chronocognizance
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

The flows and ebbs of time are obvious to you, as are the tangles that form when it's distorted. You're automatically aware if any creature that you observe is under the effects of the [[Slowed|Slowed]] or [[Quickened]] conditions. You have a general idea when you're in the vicinity of time-manipulating phenomena, though this grants you no particular insight into the specific effects of the anomaly. Particularly subtle temporal anomalies might still escape your notice, requiring a Perception check, as determined by the GM. If you're legendary in Arcana, Nature, or Occultism, or Religion, whenever a creature that you can observe gains the benefits of _[[Freeze Time]]_ or similar effects, you can observe what happens during the stopped time, though you still can't act yourself for the duration.
