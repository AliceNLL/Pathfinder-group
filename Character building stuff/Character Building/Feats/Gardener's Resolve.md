# Gardener's Resolve
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** You roll a failure (but not a critical failure) on a Will save against a fear effect.

The Gray Gardeners are known for having nerves of steel and an unbreakable resolve. When you would be overwhelmed by terror, you can draw upon this resolve to keep your composure and remain undaunted. You take mental damage equal to twice your level, and the saving throw is a success.
