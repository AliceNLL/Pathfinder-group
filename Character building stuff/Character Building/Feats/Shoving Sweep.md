# Shoving Sweep
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** A creature within your reach leaves a square during a move action it's using.

**Requirements** You are wielding a melee weapon in two hands.

* * *

You swing your weapon at your foe, rebuffing them back. You attempt to [[Shove]] the triggering creature, ignoring the requirement that you have a hand free. The creature continues its movement after the Shove.
