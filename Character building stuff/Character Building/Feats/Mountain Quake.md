# Mountain Quake
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** You are in [[Mountain Stance]]

* * *

You stomp, shaking the earth beneath you. Creatures on the ground within a 20 foot emanation take damage equal to your Strength modifier (minimum 0), which they can resist with a DC resolve fortitude save against your class DC. On a failure, they also fall [[Prone]].

After you use this action, you can't use it again for 1d4 rounds.

* * *

**Special** If you have this feat, the Dexterity modifier cap to your AC while using Mountain Stance increases from +1 to +2.
