# Mega Bomb
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** You are holding an infused alchemical bomb you crafted, with a level at least 3 lower than your advanced alchemy level

* * *

You add an incredibly powerful additive to a held bomb to create a mega bomb, greatly increasing its area and power.

You use an [[Interact]] action to throw the mega bomb, rather than Strike, and you don't make an attack roll.

The mega bomb affects creatures in a 30-foot-radius burst, centered within 60 feet of you. The bomb deals damage as if each creature were the primary target, with a basic Reflex save. On a failed save, a creature also takes any extra effects that affect a primary target (such as off-guard from bottled lightning). While all targets in the area take splash damage as primary targets, there is no further splash beyond that area.

If your next action after creating a mega bomb isn't an Interact action to throw it, the mega bomb denatures and loses all effects.
