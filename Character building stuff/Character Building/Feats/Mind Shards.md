# Mind Shards
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

With a swing and a thought, you detonate your mind weapon into a burst of psychic shards that shred the mind. You concentrate and unleash a 15 foot cone that deals 3d6 mental damage to all creatures in the area, with a DC resolve will save against the higher of your class DC or spell DC. After the attack, your mind weapon automatically re-forms, and you can't use this ability again for 1 minute. Mind Shards' damage increases by 1d6 at level 7 and every two levels thereafter.
