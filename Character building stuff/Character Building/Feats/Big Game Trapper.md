# Big Game Trapper
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You can set snares specifically for big prey, leaving smaller creatures unscathed. Each time you set a snare, you can choose Small, Medium, Large, or Huge. That snare can be triggered only by creatures of that size or larger.
