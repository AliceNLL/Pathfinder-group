# Hamstringing Strike
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You slow your foes with a well-aimed attack. Make a Strike against your hunted prey with a -2 penalty. If you hit your prey, the creature takes a -5-foot status penalty to Speed. If you critically hit your prey, the creature takes a -10-foot status penalty to Speed. A creature immune to bleed damage does not take this penalty. The penalty can be removed using any method that removes persistent bleed damage or offers a flat check to do so, such as Administer First Aid.
