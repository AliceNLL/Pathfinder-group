# Pierce the Darkness
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your eyes have adapted to see in all circumstances, even without the assistance of light. You gain [[Darkvision]], allowing you to see in darkness and dim light just as well as you can in bright light. However, in darkness you see in black and white only.
