# Draconic Scent
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your sense of smell is uncanny, much like a dragon's. You gain imprecise scent with a range of 30 feet.

The GM might double the range if you're downwind from the creature or halve the range if you're upwind, at their discretion.
