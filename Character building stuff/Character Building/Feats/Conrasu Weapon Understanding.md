# Conrasu Weapon Understanding
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You have come to know conrasu weapons as you know yourself. Whenever you critically hit using a [[Composite Shortbow]], [[Glaive]], [[Longspear]], [[Longsword]], [[Shortbow]], [[Spear]], or a conrasu weapon([[Buugeng]]), you apply the weapon's critical specialization effect.
