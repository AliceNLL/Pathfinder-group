# Floral Restoration
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

You request that nearby plants share their vitality with you to replenish your body and magic. You regain 1 Focus Point and 4d8 Hit Points.

You must be in a location of at least 15 square feet with healthy plant life, though this can be grass, lichen, seaweed, or any other form of naturally occurring flora. Using Floral Restoration on a given section of nature does not harm it, but it prevents that section of nature from giving its vitality to another use of Floral Restoration for 24 hours.

At 9th level, and every 2 levels thereafter, increase the healing by 1d8.
