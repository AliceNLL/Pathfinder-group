# Twist the Knife
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** Your last action was a melee Strike that dealt sneak attack damage to an [[Off-Guard]] target.

* * *

After stabbing your opponent in a weak spot, you tear the wound open. You deal persistent bleed damage to the target equal to your number of sneak attack damage dice.
