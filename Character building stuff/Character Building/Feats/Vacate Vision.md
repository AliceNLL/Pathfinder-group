# Vacate Vision
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** You fail (but don't critically fail) a saving throw against an effect with the visual trait.

* * *

You cause your eyes to liquefy and run out of your eye sockets, leaving them empty. You get a success on the save against the triggering effect, but you are [[Blinded]] for the duration the effect would have had on a failure. At that time, your eyes regrow and your normal vision returns.
