# Scouring Rage
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** You [[Rage]].

* * *

You emit a powerful surge of instinctual energy when you unleash your potential. Each adjacent creature takes damage equal to your level (DC resolve fortitude save against your class DC) of the same type as your additional damage during that Rage.
