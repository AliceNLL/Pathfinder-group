# Spell Devourer
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You don't just resist magic; you devour it. Whenever you succeed at a saving throw against a spell or magical effect, you gain temporary Hit Points equal to double the spell's rank, or equal to the level if the magical effect isn't a spell. These temporary Hit Points last until the end of your next turn.
