# Inventor Dedication
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You become trained in Crafting and inventor class DC. You gain the [[Inventor]] skill feat, even if you don't meet the skill feat's requirements. Choose an innovation. You gain that [[Innovation]], though you don't gain any other abilities that modify or use that innovation, such as modifications or Explode.

**Special** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have first gained two other feats from the [[Inventor]] archetype.
