**Frequency** once per 10 minutes

**Trigger** Another creature within 30 feet of you that can see you would gain the [[Frightened]] condition.

You give a target a stern glower to remind them that it is you, and no one else, they should truly fear. Reduce the value of the frightened condition the creature would take by 1.
