# Patch Job
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You can patch up damage to an object with a quick fix. You gain the [[Improvised Repair]] general feat. When you use Improvised Repair, you can attempt a Crafting check with the same DC as Repair. If you succeed, you can use the object as a normal object of its type until it takes damage rather than as a shoddy object of its type.
