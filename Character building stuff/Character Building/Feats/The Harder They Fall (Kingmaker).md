# The Harder They Fall (Kingmaker)
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You know how to make a larger creature hurt when it falls to the ground. If you successfully [[Trip]] a foe that's larger than you, it takes 1d8 bludgeoning damage (or 2d8 bludgeoning damage on a critical success). If you are master in Athletics, the damage increases to 2d8 bludgeoning damage (or 4d8 bludgeoning damage on a critical success).
