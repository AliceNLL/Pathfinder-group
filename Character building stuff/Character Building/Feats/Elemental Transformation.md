# Elemental Transformation
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Frequency** once per day

**Requirements** Your kinetic gate is deactivated.

* * *

You open your kinetic gate, but rather than activating your kinetic aura, you instead become overwhelmed with transformative elemental energy. You're affected by an _[[Elemental Form]]_ spell with the same trait as your kinetic element. You can heighten it to any spell rank up to half your level rounded up.
