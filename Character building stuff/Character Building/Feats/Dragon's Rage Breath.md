# Dragon's Rage Breath
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** You haven't used this ability since you last Raged

* * *

You breathe deeply and exhale powerful energy in a 30 foot cone or 60 foot line, dealing 1d6 damage per level. The area and damage type match those of your dragon (see [[Dragon Instinct|Table 3-4]]).

If you used this ability in the last hour, the area and the damage are halved (15-foot cone or 30 foot line; 1d6 damage for every 2 levels).

Each creature in the area must attempt a DC resolve reflex save.
