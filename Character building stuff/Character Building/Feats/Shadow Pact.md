# Shadow Pact
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Thousands of years ago, your ancestors made a pact with [[Zon-Kuthon]]. He has not forgotten, even if you might wish he had. You can take 1 damage to mix blood and shadows to cast 5th-level _[[Creation]]_ as an innate divine spell. You can use this ability as often as you wish, but you can have only one such object in existence at a time. If the object encounters bright light, the spell ends and the object dissolves into shadows.
