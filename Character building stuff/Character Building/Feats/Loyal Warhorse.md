# Loyal Warhorse
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You and your mount have grown closer, and your loyalty to each other is unbreakable. The mount you gained through the divine ally class feature is now a mature animal companion. In addition, your mount never attacks you, even if it is magically compelled to do so.
