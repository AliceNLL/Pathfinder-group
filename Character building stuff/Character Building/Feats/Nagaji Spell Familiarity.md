# Nagaji Spell Familiarity
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Either through study, exposure, or familial devotion, you have the magic of nagas bubbling in your blood. During your daily preparations, choose _[[Daze]]_, [[Detect Magic]], or _[[Telekinetic Hand]]_. Until your next daily preparations, you can cast the chosen spell as an occult innate cantrip. A cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up.
