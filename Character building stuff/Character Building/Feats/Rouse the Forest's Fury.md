# Rouse the Forest's Fury
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Terrifying trees attack your enemies. Three Large trees appear in unoccupied spaces within 500 feet, at least 15 feet from one another. Each tree has AC 40, Fortitude +33, Reflex +24, Will +30, and 200 HP. The trees can flank, but are unable to move. When the trees appear, each makes a Strike; they share a multiple attack penalty. The tree's melee Strike is a branch that has reach 10 feet; on a hit, the target is [[Grabbed]] by the tree ([[Escape]] DC 40). The ranged Strike is a hurled fruit, gourd, seed, or stone with a range increment of 60 feet. Either Strike has a +30 attack modifier and deals 4d10+9 bludgeoning damage.

The trees last until the end of your next turn, and you can Sustain the impulse. Each time you Sustain the impulse, you can have one tree make a Strike.
