# Quiet Allies
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You're skilled at moving with a group. When you are [[Avoid Notice|Avoid ingNotice]] and your allies [[Follow the Expert]], you and those allies can roll a single Stealth check, using the lowest modifier, instead of rolling separately. This doesn't apply for initiative rolls.
