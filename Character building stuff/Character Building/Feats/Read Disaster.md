# Read Disaster
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You spend 10 minutes and open yourself to the divine mysteries of the world, peering into the most sinister portents of the future.

You gain the effects of _[[Augury]]_, except you learn only about the dangers ahead; any results of "weal" are instead "nothing," and results of "weal and woe" are instead "woe." If you are legendary in Religion, you take only 1 minute to Read Disaster.
