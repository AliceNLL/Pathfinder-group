# Prevailing Position
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** You are targeted by an attack or attempt a Reflex saving throw against a damaging effect, and you are in a stance.

* * *

Your willingness to flow from one stance to another lets you sacrifice their benefits to better protect yourself.

You leave the stance you were in, gaining a +4 circumstance bonus to the triggering saving throw or to your AC against the triggering attack.
