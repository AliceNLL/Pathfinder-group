# Inner Fire (Ifrit)
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You can call the fire inside you into the palm of your hand. You can cast the _[[Produce Flame]]_ cantrip as an innate primal or arcane spell at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up.
