# Shadow Power
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You can focus the shadows into a powerful blast. You can cast _[[Shadow Blast]]_ as an innate occult spell once per day. Its level is always 1 level lower than the level of your shadowdancer focus spells. You become an expert in occult spell attack rolls and DCs.
