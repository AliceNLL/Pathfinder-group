# Path Of Iron
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Frequency** once per minute

* * *

With a burst of effort, you weave a path through your enemies, striking each in turn as you move past them. You Stride; this movement doesn't trigger reactions. You can Strike up to three times at any point during your movement, each against a different enemy.

Each attack counts toward your multiple attack penalty, but your multiple attack penalty doesn't increase until you have made all your attacks.
