# Selfless Parry
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You protect those near you with a flash of steel. When you're benefiting from Dueling Parry, allies adjacent to you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to AC.

If you have [[Dueling Riposte]], you can use it when an enemy within your reach critically fails a Strike against an ally adjacent to you, not just against yourself.
