# Arcane Shroud
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Frequency** once per turn

**Requirements** Your most recent action was to Cast a Spell from a spell slot or make a Spellstrike with a spell from a spell slot.

* * *

Your magic has a powerful aftereffect, briefly granting you a certain spell. When you take this feat, choose three of [[False Vitality]], [[Fire Shield]], [[Fleet Step]], [[Flicker]], [[Invisibility]], [[Mountain Resilience]], and [[See the Unseen]]. You use Arcane Cascade and are subject to an additional aftereffect spell of your choice from the three you selected. This aftereffect spell's duration lasts until the end of your next turn or its normal duration, whichever is shorter. Using Arcane Shroud again ends any existing spell you gained from Arcane Shroud.
