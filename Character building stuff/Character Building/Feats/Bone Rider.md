# Bone Rider
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Using your ancestors' bones, you manifest their spirits around you in a fossilized form, terrifying your foes. You can cast _[[Mask of Terror]]_ on yourself as a primal innate spell once per day. When you do, you appear as a skeletal lizardfolk ancestor, twisted in a way that inspires the deepest fears of those who observe you.
