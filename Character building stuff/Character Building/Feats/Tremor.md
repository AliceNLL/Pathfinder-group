# Tremor
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You unleash a small, localized tremor in a 10 foot burst within 30 feet. Each creature in the area takes 2d10 bludgeoning damage with a DC resolve fortitude save against your class DC. A creature that critically fails is knocked [[Prone]]. Earth and stone in the area is difficult terrain until the start of your next turn.

* * *

**Level (+2)** The damage increases by 1d10.
