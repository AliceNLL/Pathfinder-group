# Parry And Riposte
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your parries and finishers allow you to riposte with the slightest provocation.

You can use [[Opportune Riposte]] against an enemy who fails at a Strike against you (not just critically fails), provided you have both damaged that creature with a finisher on your last turn and currently have a circumstance bonus to AC from the parry weapon trait, [[Dueling Parry (Swashbuckler)|Dueling Parry]], or [[Twin Parry]].
