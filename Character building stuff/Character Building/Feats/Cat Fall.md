# Cat Fall
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your catlike aerial acrobatics allow you to cushion your falls. Treat falls as 10 feet shorter. If you're an expert in Acrobatics, treat falls as 25 feet shorter and 50 feet if you're a master. If you're legendary in Acrobatics, you always land on your feet and don't take damage, regardless of the distance of the fall.
