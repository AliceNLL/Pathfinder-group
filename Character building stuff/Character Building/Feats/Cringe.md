# Cringe
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** A creature you are aware of critically succeeds on a Strike against you and would deal damage to you.

* * *

With pitiful posturing, you cause your foe to pull back a deadly attack. The attacking creature takes a circumstance penalty to the damage of the triggering Strike equal to your level + 2. This penalty applies after doubling the damage for a critical hit. The attacker is then immune to your Cringe for 24 hours.
