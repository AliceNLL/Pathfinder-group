# Shall not Falter, Shall not Rout
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You gain the _[[Shall not Falter, Shall not Rout]]_ focus spell. If you don't already have one, you gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point, which you can regain using the Refocus activity to recite the Crimson Oath and meditate on its teachings. If you already have a focus pool, increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1. Your knight reclaimant focus spells are divine spells; when you gain this feat, you become trained in divine spell attacks and spell DCs and your spellcasting ability is Charisma.
