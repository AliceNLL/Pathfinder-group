# Ensnaring Wrappings
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** Your Strike deals physical damage to a creature that is within reach of your arms and isn't more than one size larger than you.

* * *

Some of your wrappings come loose to ensnare a creature you recently damaged. You attempt to [[Grapple]] the creature you damaged.
