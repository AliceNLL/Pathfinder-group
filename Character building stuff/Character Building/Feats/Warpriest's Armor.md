# Warpriest's Armor
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your training has helped you adapt to ever-heavier armor. You are trained in heavy armor. Whenever you gain a class feature that grants you expert or greater proficiency in medium armor, you also gain that proficiency in heavy armor. You treat armor you wear of 2 Bulk or higher as though it were 1 Bulk lighter (to a minimum of 1 Bulk).
