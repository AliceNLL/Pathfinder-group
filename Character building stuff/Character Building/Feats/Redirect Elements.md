# Redirect Elements
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** The spell attack roll for a foe's spell with an elemental trait targeting you fails or critically fails, and the elemental trait is in your elemental philosophy.

* * *

You seize the elemental essence of an incoming spell and redirect the spell to a creature of your choice within the spell's area. The attacker rerolls the spell's attack roll against the new target.
