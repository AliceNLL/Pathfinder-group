# Springing Leaper
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your powerful legs allow you to make sudden and dramatic leaps. You can [[Leap]] as a 2-action activity to double the distance you can Leap vertically, or Leap as a 3-action activity to triple the distance you can Leap vertically. You don't automatically fail [[Long Jump]] for jumping in a different direction than your Stride.
