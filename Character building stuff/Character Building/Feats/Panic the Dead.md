# Panic the Dead
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Vitality strikes terror in the undead. When you use a [[Heal]] spell to damage undead, any undead that fails its saving throw is also [[Frightened|Frightened 1]]. If it critically failed, the creature also gains the [[Fleeing]] condition until the start of your next turn. Mindless undead are not immune to this effect due to being mindless.
