# Iron Repercussions
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Disobeying your [[Iron Command]] has lasting consequences. If an enemy refuses to kneel to you, you can deal [[Persistent Damage|Persistent Mental Damage]] instead of normal mental damage. You must decide whether the mental damage will be persistent before your enemy chooses whether to kneel or not. The amount of damage is unchanged.
