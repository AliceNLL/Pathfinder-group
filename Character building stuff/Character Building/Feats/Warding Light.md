# Warding Light
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You gain a tattoo that serves as a special ward to defend you against Walkena's forces.

The tattoo allows you to cast the _[[Light]]_ cantrip as a divine innate spell at will. The cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up. If you die, the tattoo immediately casts _[[Peaceful Rest]]_ on your corpse, heightened to the same spell level.
