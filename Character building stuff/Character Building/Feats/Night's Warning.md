# Night's Warning
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** A creature targets you with an attack and you can see the attacker.

**Frequency** once per hour

**Requirements** You can see the night sky.

* * *

Portents written in the night sky show you how to avoid an attack. The triggering attack roll targets your Occultism DC instead of your AC. Though this allows you to avoid taking penalties to your AC, it doesn't remove any conditions or other effects causing such penalties. For example, an enemy with sneak attack would still deal extra damage to you for being off-guard, even though you wouldn't take the â€“2 circumstance penalty when defending against the attack.
