# Knock Sense
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You attack carefully to knock some sense into a creature whose actions aren't their own. Make a Strike against a [[Confused]] ally. The Strike is nonlethal and doesn't take a -2 penalty for using a weapon without the nonlethal trait; if you hit and deal damage, your ally automatically succeeds at the flat check to remove the confused condition when taking damage.
