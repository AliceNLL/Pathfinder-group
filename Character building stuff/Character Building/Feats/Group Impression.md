# Group Impression
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

When you [[Make an Impression]], you can compare your Diplomacy check result to the Will DCs of up to 10 targets you conversed with, with no penalty. The number of targets increases to 20 if you're an expert, 50 if you're a master, and 100 if you're legendary.
