# Overwhelming Breath
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You control your breathing and align it with your ki, exhaling with controlled force in order to overcome your opponent's resistance.

If you use your next action to Cast a Spell that has the monk trait and no duration, the spell and any Strikes you make as a result of casting it ignore an amount of the target's resistance to physical damage equal to your level.
