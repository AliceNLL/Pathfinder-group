# Unfettered Halfling
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You were either pressed into indentured servitude or shackled in a prison, but you've since escaped and have trained to ensure you'll never be caught again. Whenever you roll a success on a check to [[Escape]] or a saving throw against an effect that would impose the [[Grabbed]], [[Immobilized]], or [[Restrained]] condition on you, you get a critical success instead. Whenever a creature rolls a failure on a check to [[Grapple]] you, it gets a critical failure instead.
