# Unexpected Shift
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** You would take damage from an attack, spell, or other effect.

* * *

Your supernatural connection sometimes causes you to phase from reality when under threat, disappearing for split seconds before reappearing-often surprising you as much as your enemies. Roll a DC 16 flat. On a success, you gain resistance to all damage equal to your level against the triggering effect, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saving throws against that effect until the start of your turn, and you gain the [[Dazzled]] condition for 1 round.
