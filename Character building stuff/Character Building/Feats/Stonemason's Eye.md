# Stonemason's Eye
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You understand the intricacies of stonework. You become trained in Crafting. If you're already trained in Crafting, you instead gain the [[Specialty Crafting]] skill feat for stonemasonry.

You also gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks to notice unusual stonework. This bonus applies to checks to discover mechanical traps made of stone or [[Hidden]] within stone.

If you aren't using the [[Seek]] action or searching, the GM automatically rolls a secret check for you to notice unusual stonework anyway. This check doesn't gain your normal circumstance bonus.
