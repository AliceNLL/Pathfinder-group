# Mask Of Pain
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** You succeed at a Demoralize check.

* * *

**Requirements** You're wearing your _warmask_.

* * *

Your mask has grown into a manifestation of your pain, which you can release. The creature you successfully Demoralized takes 4d6 mental damage if you're legendary in Intimidation. The target is then temporarily immune to additional damage from Mask of Pain for 24 hours.
