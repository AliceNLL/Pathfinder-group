# Advanced First Aid
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You use your medical training to ameliorate sickness or assuage fears. When you use Medicine to [[Administer First Aid]], instead of Stabilizing a character or Stopping Bleeding, you can reduce an ally's [[Frightened|Frightened 1]] or [[Sickened 1]] condition by 2, or remove either of those conditions entirely on a critical success. You can remove only one condition at a time. The DC for the Medicine check is usually the DC of the effect that caused the condition.
