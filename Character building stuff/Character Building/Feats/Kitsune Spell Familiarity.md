# Kitsune Spell Familiarity
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You've picked up a few magical tricks. During your daily preparations, choose _[[Daze]]_, _[[Forbidding Ward]]_, or _[[Ghost Sound]]_. Until your next daily preparations, you can cast this cantrip as a divine innate spell at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up.
