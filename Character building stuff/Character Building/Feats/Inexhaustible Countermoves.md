# Inexhaustible Countermoves
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You can react whenever a foe leaves a gap in their defenses. At the start of each enemy's turn, you gain an extra reaction you can use only during that turn to perform an [[Opportune Riposte]], or an [[Reactive Strike]] if you have that reaction.
