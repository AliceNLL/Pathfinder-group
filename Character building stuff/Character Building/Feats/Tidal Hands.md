# Tidal Hands
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

With an emphatic gesture, you create waves that rush out from you in the shape of your hands. You either form two 15-Foot Cones that don't overlap or you combine the hands into one 30-Foot Cone. Each creature in a wave takes 1d8 bludgeoning damage with a DC 0 Basic Reflex save against your class DC. If a creature critically fails, you also push that creature 5 feet.

* * *

**Level (+2)** The damage increases by 1d8.
