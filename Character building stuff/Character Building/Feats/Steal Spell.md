# Steal Spell
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

When you use [[Legendary Thief]] to steal the impossible, you can steal a prepared spell or spontaneous spell from a foe. The spell is randomly selected from the highest-level spells the foe knows that have a target or area, to a maximum of 8th-level spells; the target loses the appropriate spell slot as if they had cast it themself.

You can Cast the Spell once within the next `dice: 1d4` rounds, after which the fleeting magic fades; this otherwise works the same as casting a [[Loaner Spell]].
