# Vernai Training
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

To resurrect a creature you've slain, a spellcaster must counteract your influence on its death. The DC of this check is equal to your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.

In addition, add two 5th-level spells to your Red Mantis assassin spellbook-both spells must be chosen from the following options:

*   _[[Death Ward]]_,
*   _[[Drop Dead]]_,
*   _[[False Vision]]_,
*   _[[Hallucination]]_,
*   _[[Illusory Scene]]_,
*   _[[Mind Probe]]_, or
*   _[[Sending]]_.

You gain a 5th-level spell slot that you can use to prepare a spell from your Red Mantis assassin spellbook.
