**Requirements** You are riding your mount and wielding a jousting weapon.

* * *

You attempt to knock an opponent off their mount. Make a melee Strike against a mounted opponent. If your attack hits, attempt an athletics check against the opponent's Fortitude DC. If you succeed, the foe is knocked off its mount into a space of its choice adjacent to its mount. If you critically succeed, it lands [[Prone]].
