# Animal Magic
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your shapeshifting grants you a magical connection to the animal world. You can cast _[[Animal Messenger]]_, _[[Calm]]_ (animals only), and _[[Speak with Animals]]_ as 2nd-level primal innate spells once per day each. These spells use your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.
