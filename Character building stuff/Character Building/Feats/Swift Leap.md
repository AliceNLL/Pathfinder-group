# Swift Leap
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your undead physiology allows you to leap quickly toward or away from your opponent. You [[Leap]]. This movement doesn't trigger reactions.

If you are satiated, you can choose to end your satiation to instead [[High Jump]] or [[Long Jump]] without triggering reactions, as you take a quick, enormous jump before any foe can react to your movement.
