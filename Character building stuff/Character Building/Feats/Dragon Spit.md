# Dragon Spit
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Many Tian-Dan claim to have dragon blood in their veins, and in your case, this is true-you can spit energy, and you might have an especially visible sign of your draconic heritage. Choose one of the following cantrips: _[[Acid Splash]]_, _[[Electric Arc]]_, _[[Produce Flame]]_, or _[[Ray of Frost]]_. You can cast this spell as an innate arcane spell at will, and when you cast it, the spell's energy emerges from your mouth.
