# Time Dilation Cascade
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You borrow a bit of time from the future to act now. Make six Strikes. Your multiple attack penalty applies normally to these Strikes. If you successfully hit a creature with multiple Strikes, combine those Strikes' damage for the purpose of resistances and weaknesses. On your next turn, you regain 1 action instead of 3. This is before any alteration in your actions due to the quickened, slowed, and stunned conditions.
