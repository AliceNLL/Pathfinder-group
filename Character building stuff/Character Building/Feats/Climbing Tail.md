# Climbing Tail
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your tail makes it much easier for you to climb. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Athletics checks to Climb, you gain the [[Combat Climber]] skill feat, and you reduce the number of free hands required to Climb or [[Trip]] by one.
