# Cruelty
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

The harm you deal with your corrupting touch saps the strength from your enemy's body.

If your next action is to cast _[[Touch of Corruption]]_ on a living creature, the target is also [[Enfeebled 1]] for 1 minute if it fails its save (enfeebled 2 if it critically fails).
