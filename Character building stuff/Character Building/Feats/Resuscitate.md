# Resuscitate
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** You are holding a [[Healer's Toolkit]] or are wearing them and have a hand free. Also, the target's body is mostly intact.

* * *

You can use Medicine to resuscitate the dead. Attempt a DC 40 medicine check to revive a dead creature that has been dead for no more than 3 rounds. If you succeed, the target returns to life with the effects of _[[Raise Dead]]_, except it still has the [[Wounded]] condition it had before [[Dying]], increased by 1 (or wounded 1 if it wasn't wounded before dying). Whether you succeed or fail, the target is temporarily immune to Resuscitate for 1 day.
