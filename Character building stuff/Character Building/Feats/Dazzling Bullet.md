# Dazzling Bullet
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your tricks discombobulate your opponent, leaving spots in their vision from the bright flash of your gunshot reflected straight into their eyes (or other visual organs). Attempt a performance check against the target creature's Will DC and make a ranged firearm Strike against that target. If the Strike deals damage to the target creature and you succeed at the Performance check, the creature is [[Dazzled]] for 1 round.
