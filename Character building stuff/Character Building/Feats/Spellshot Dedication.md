# Spellshot Dedication
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You've steeped yourself in magic and gunplay to the extent that you can conjure bullets from thin air, using a rudimentary knowledge of arcane theory to create a temporary piece of ammunition. You gain the [[Conjure Bullet]] action.

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat other than Beast Gunner Dedication until you've gained two other feats from the [[Spellshot (Class Archetype)|Spellshot]] or [[Beast Gunner]] archetypes.
