# Stone Guardian
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You learn to call a powerful guardian of earth and stone to your side. You can cast _[[Summon Elemental]]_ as an innate primal spell once per day, and can only summon elementals with the earth trait. This spell is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up.
