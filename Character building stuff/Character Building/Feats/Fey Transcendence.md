# Fey Transcendence
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You become a powerful fey creature, gaining strengths tied to the First World but also some of the weakness against which all fey must contend. You gain a +2 status bonus to saves against illusion and emotion effects, and you can use Diplomacy to [[Make an Impression]] on and to make very simple [[Request|Requests]] of animals and plants. You regain twice the number of Hit Points when resting in a natural wooded area, such as a forest or jungle. You have weakness to cold iron equal to half your level.

**Special** This feat gains the trait appropriate for your ancestry (human for human, goblin for goblin, etc.).
