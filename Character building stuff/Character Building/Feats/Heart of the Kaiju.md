# Heart of the Kaiju
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Witnessing the might of the kaiju King Mogaru, Alru, and Toraloa up close awoke a new ferocity within you. When you transform using [[Monstrosity Shape]], you can take on a kaiju form. When you take this feat, choose acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage; this is the damage your breath weapon deals. You can't change this later. The battle form is Gargantuan size with the following specific abilities; the damage values already include the extra die from being a 9th-level spell.

**Kaiju** Speed 40 feet; physical resistance 5;

**Melee** 1 jaws (reach 20 feet), **Damage** 3d12+20 piercing damage;

**Melee** 1 claws (agile, reach 20 feet), **Damage** 3d8+20 slashing damage

**Breath Weapon** 2 (evocation, primal) Each creature in a 60 foot cone takes 1d4 rounds.
