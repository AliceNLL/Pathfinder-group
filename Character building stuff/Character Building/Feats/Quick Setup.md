# Quick Setup
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You have learned to setup simple crafting jobs with ease. Your setup time for consumables that are at least 6 levels lower than you is 1 day, and your setup time for permanent items 6 levels lower than you is 3 days.

If you rush the setup and reduce the setup time for consumables at least 6 levels lower than you to less than 1 day, you can instead set them up in just 2 hours (allowing you to do so during an adventuring day if you have access to your tools and materials). If you rush the setup of a permanent item at least 6 levels lower than you and reduce the setup time to less than 1 day, you can perform the setup in 4 hours.
