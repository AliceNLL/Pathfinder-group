Through countless battles, you've learned you're stronger when working alongside your allies. Make a Strike. Your Strike gains a circumstance bonus to damage rolls equal to the number of other different creatures that damaged the target since the end of the target's last turn, to a maximum of a +4 circumstance bonus.
