# Unwind Death
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** The target's body must be mostly intact.

* * *

Combining necromancy with the mysterious temporal powers of clockwork, you wind a creature backward from the moment of its death. Attempt a DC 40 crafting check to revive a dead creature that has been dead for no more than 3 rounds. If you succeed, the target returns to life with the effects of _[[Raise Dead]]_, except it still has the wounded condition it had before dying, increased by 1 (or wounded 1 if it wasn't wounded before dying). Whether you succeed or fail, the target is then temporarily immune to Unwind Death for 1 day.
