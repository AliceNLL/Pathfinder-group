# Swift Banishment
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** You critically hit a creature that is not on its home plane.

**Requirements** You have a [[Banishment]] spell prepared.

* * *

The force of your blow sends your victim back to its home plane. You expend a _banishment_ spell you have prepared, affecting the creature you critically hit without needing to cast the spell. The creature can attempt to resist the spell as normal.
