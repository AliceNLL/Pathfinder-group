# Fearsome Brute
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Fear makes your foes weak and more vulnerable to your attacks. You gain a circumstance bonus to damage rolls for Strikes against [[Frightened]] creatures. The bonus is equal to double the target's frightened value.

If you're a master in Intimidation, increase the bonus to triple the target's frightened value.
