# Arcane Camouflage
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You have developed magical techniques to aid you with stalking your prey. You can cast _[[Blur]]_ and _[[Invisibility]]_ each once per day as 2nd-level arcane innate spells.

**Enhancement** Your camouflage is more potent. Your blur spell now lasts 10 minutes and when you cast invisibility, you can choose to gain the effects of the 4th-level version of the spell. In addition, you can now cast blur and invisibility each twice per day.
