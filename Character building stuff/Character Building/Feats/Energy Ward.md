# Energy Ward
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Frequency** once per turn

**Requirements** Your most recent action was to cast a non-cantrip spell that dealt energy damage.

* * *

You trap energy from the last spell you cast within your body, coating your flesh in a protective ward. Until the start of your next turn, you gain resistance 5 to one type of energy damage dealt by the spell you just cast.
