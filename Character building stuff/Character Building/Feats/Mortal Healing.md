# Mortal Healing
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You grant greater healing when the gods don't interfere. When you roll a success to [[Treat Wounds]] for a creature that hasn't regained Hit Points from divine magic in the past 24 hours, you get a critical success on your check instead and restore the corresponding amount of Hit Points.
