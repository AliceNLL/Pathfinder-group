# Storm Retribution
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** An opponent adjacent to you critically hits you with a melee weapon or melee unarmed attack.

**Requirements** You have at least 1 available Focus Point.

* * *

You lash out, directing a burst of storming fury toward a creature that has harmed you. You cast [[Tempest Surge]] on the triggering opponent and push that creature, moving it 5 feet away from you if it fails its Reflex save, or 10 feet if it critically fails. This movement is forced movement.
