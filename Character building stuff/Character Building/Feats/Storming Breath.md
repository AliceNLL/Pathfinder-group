# Storming Breath
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You spit out a freezing breath or sonic scream. You deal 4d6 damage, plus 1d6 damage for every level you have beyond 6th, to all creatures in a 30 foot cone, with a DC resolve reflex save.

* * *

**Awakening** Your blast powerfully batters your foes. A creature that critically fails its save is knocked [[Prone]].

* * *

**Awakening** The kickback of your blast helps you make a speedy escape. When you use this ability, you Fly backward 15 feet in a straight line directly opposite your blast. This movement doesn't trigger reactions based on movement.
