# Fleeing Diversion
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You are quick to capitalize on your distractions. If you critically succeed at your check to [[Create a Diversion]] against the majority of the creatures (at least half of the creatures) whose attention you're trying to divert, you can use your reaction to immediately [[Hide]], [[Sneak]], or Step. As normal, you are only [[Hidden]] to creatures against which you succeed on your check to [[Create a Diversion]], even if you manage to Hide or Sneak away.
