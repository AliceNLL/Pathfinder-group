**Druid** You infuse your familiar with additional primal energy, increasing its abilities.

**Magus** You infuse your familiar with more magical energy.

**Sorcerer, Wizard, Witch** You infuse your familiar with additional magical energy.

**Thaumaturge** By applying the best of multiple traditions of magic, you've found a more efficient way for your familiar to store its energy.

You can select four familiar or master abilities each day, instead of two.

**Special** Add the bonus familiar abilities you gain for being a witch to this amount. If your arcane thesis is [[Improved Familiar Attunement]], your familiar's base number of familiar abilities, before adding any extra abilities from the arcane thesis, is four.
