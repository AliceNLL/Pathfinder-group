You can move through gloom with the speed of darkness. You can move 5 feet farther when you take the Sneak action, up to your Speed. In addition, as long as you continue to use Sneak actions and succeed at your Stealth check, you don't become [[Observed]] if you end a Sneak action in dim light or darkness, as long as you have cover or greater cover or are [[Concealed]] at the end of your turn.
