# Reach Beyond
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You've learned to move your spiritual energy past yourself to attack spirits where others can't. You can make melee Strikes against incorporeal creatures that are inside solid objects as long as the object is within your reach. An incorporeal creature inside of a solid object is hidden, requiring you to succeed at a DC 11 flat to affect the creature.
