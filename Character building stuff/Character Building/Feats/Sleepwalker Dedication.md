# Sleepwalker Dedication
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You've learned to manipulate states of consciousness, beginning with your own. You can send yourself into a half-awake, daydreaming state and gain the [[Daydream Trance]] action.

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the [[Sleepwalker]] archetype.
