# Phonetic Training
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You can pronounce and repeat words with near-perfect accuracy even if you don't understand their meaning, and you can write them down in a phonetic script that allows you or another creature with Phonetic Training to read it later. Even if the words are in a language with sound you can't pronounce, you can faithfully transcribe them. Memorizing long sequences of words remains just as difficult as it is normally.
