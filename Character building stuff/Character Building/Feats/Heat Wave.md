![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** An effect would deal fire damage to you, even if you resist all the damage.

**Frequency** once per 10 minutes

You harness the oncoming flames and twist them into a screen of heat and smoke, granting you [[Concealed|concealment]] until the beginning of your next turn.
