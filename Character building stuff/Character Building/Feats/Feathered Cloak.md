# Feathered Cloak
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

To blend in with the grounded and wingless, you fold your wings just so on your back, creating the illusion of a feathered cloak. You receive a +2 circumstance bonus to Deception checks to [[Impersonate]] a version of yourself who is not a strix. Additionally, your folded wings help you obscure objects on your person, providing a +2 circumstance bonus to Stealth checks to [[Conceal an Object]].
