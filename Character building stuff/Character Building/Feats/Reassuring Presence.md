# Reassuring Presence
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** An ally within 30 feet gains the frightened condition.

* * *

You serve as an anchor to your close companions, calming them in times of stress. Decrease the value of the triggering ally's [[Frightened]] condition by 1. The ally is then temporarily immune to your Reassuring Presence for 1 hour.
