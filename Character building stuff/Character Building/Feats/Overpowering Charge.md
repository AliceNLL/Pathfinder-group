# Overpowering Charge
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You trample foes as you charge past. When you use Barreling Charge and successfully move through a creature's space, that creature takes bludgeoning damage equal to your Strength modifier. On a critical success, the creature takes double damage and is [[Off-Guard]] until the end of your next turn.
