# Breath Control
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You can breathe even in hazardous or sparse air. You can hold your breath for 25 times as long as usual before suffocating. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against inhaled threats, such as inhaled poisons, and if you roll a success on such a saving throw, you get a critical success instead.
