![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

DC 17 flat{Unstable Check}

On a failure, the innovation malfunctions in a spectacular (though harmless) fashion, such as a belch of smoke or shower of sparks, and it becomes incapable of being used for further unstable actions.

On a critical failure, you also take fire damage equal to your level.
