# Daywalker (Vampire)
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Through a profane pledge or a bloodline quirk, you can tolerate the sun's light. You gain the [[Advanced Undead Benefits]] and can't be destroyed by sunlight. This doesn't prevent you from becoming [[Slowed|Slowed]] by exposure to the sun.
