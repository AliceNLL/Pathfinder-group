# Analyze Weakness
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** You have identified a creature with [[Recall Knowledge]].

* * *

Your knowledge of a creature's physiology helps you attack with pinpoint accuracy. You carefully study a creature that you've identified to scope out particularly weak points in its positioning or physical form. The next time you deal sneak attack damage to the chosen creature with a Strike before the end of your turn, add an additional 2d6 precision damage.

At 11th level, the additional damage becomes 3d6, and at 17th level it becomes 4d6.
