# Bone Magic
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your connection to your iruxi ancestors manifests as a simple primal spell that you cast using a fragment of an ancestor's bones. Choose one cantrip from the primal spell list. You can cast this cantrip as a primal innate spell at will, and it's heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up.
