# Runtsage
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Unlike most of your kind, who dismiss goblins as embarrassments or expendable annoyances, you have studied the methodology behind their irresponsible and incomprehensible actions. You gain the [[Adopted Ancestry]] general feat and must select goblin as the feat's chosen ancestry. You also gain one 1st-level goblin ancestry feat.
