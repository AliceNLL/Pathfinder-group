# Searing Restoration
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

They told you there was no way that explosions could heal people, but they were foolsâ€¦ Fools who didn't understand your brilliance! You create a minor explosion from your innovation, altering the combustion to cauterize wounds using vaporized medicinal herbs. You or a living creature adjacent to you regains level based healing. In addition, the creature you heal can attempt an immediate flat check to recover from a single source of persistent bleed damage, with the DC reduction from appropriate assistance.

Base 1d10 Hit Points. At 3rd level, and every 2 levels thereafter, increase the healing by 1d10.

**Special** If your innovation is a minion, it can take this action rather than you, though because it's not a living creature, it can't use the ability on itself.

DC 17 flat{Unstable Check}

On a failure, the innovation malfunctions in a spectacular (though harmless) fashion, such as a belch of smoke or shower of sparks, and it becomes incapable of being used for further unstable actions.

On a critical failure, you also take fire damage equal to your level.
