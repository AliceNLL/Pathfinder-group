# Quill Spray
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

You can launch a mass of quills at opponents. You spray quills in a 30 foot cone, dealing 5d8 piercing damage. Each creature in the area must attempt a DC resolve reflex saving throw against the higher of your class DC or spell DC. On a critical failure, a creature also takes 5 persistent bleed damage. At 11th level and every even level thereafter, the piercing damage increases by 1d8 and the persistent bleed damage increases by 1.

_**Note** The feat does not specify the type of saving throw required. A reflex saving throw has been added, in line with Barbed Quills._
