# Ceremony of Sun's Gift
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your connection to the sun has become an unbreakable bond. You don't become temporarily immune to the effects of your [[Sunlight Healing]], and instead of rolling to recover Hit Points, you gain the maximum number of HP possible (for example, 64 HP instead of 8d8).
