# Whirlwind Toss
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** You have a foe [[Grabbed]].

* * *

You whirl a foe to smash into all nearby creatures before throwing them far away in imitation of the techniques of your rival, Ran-To. You [[Thrash]]. During this Thrash, your [[Collateral Thrash]] feat applies to all foes adjacent to you. You can then throw the grabbed creature 10 feet, where they fall [[Prone]].

If the foe you choose for Collateral Thrash is also adjacent to you, they attempt only one save and take the damage only once.
