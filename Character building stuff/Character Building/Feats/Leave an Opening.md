# Leave an Opening
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

When you hit hard enough, you leave an opening so your ally can jump in on the action. Whenever you critically hit an [[Off-Guard]] opponent with a melee attack and deal damage, the target triggers a Reactive Strike reaction from one ally of your choice who has that reaction, as if the enemy had used a manipulate action.
