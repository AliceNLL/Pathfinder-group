# Quick Fix
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You can attach a talisman using only a bit of glue and some string. You gain the [[Rapid Affixture]] skill feat, even if you don't meet the prerequisites. When you use it, you can affix or remove up to four talismans in 1 minute instead of just one.

You gain the ability to [[Affix a Talisman]] as a 3-action activity from that feat at 12th level, regardless of your Crafting proficiency.
