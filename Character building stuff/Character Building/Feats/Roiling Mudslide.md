# Roiling Mudslide
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You form water and earth into a mudslide that smashes your opponents and coats them in mud. Each creature in the area takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage with a DC 0 Basic Fortitude save against your class DC. A creature that fails is also pushed 5 feet (or 10 feet on a critical failure) and coated in mud until the end of its next turn. While coated in mud, the creature falls Prone at the end of its movement any time it ends a move action other than a Crawl or Step. The creature can attempt an Acrobatics check or DC 0 Reflex save against your class DC, avoiding the fall if it succeeds.

* * *

**Level (+4)** The damage increases by 1d8.
