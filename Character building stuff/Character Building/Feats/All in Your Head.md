# All in Your Head
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** You're about to attempt a Fortitude save or a Reflex save.

* * *

Flames scouring at your body, venom coursing through your veins-you refuse to believe they exist, and nothing can affect you if you don't believe in it. You attempt a Will save against the triggering effect, instead of a Reflex or Fortitude save. You don't gain the benefits of fortress of will or walls of will on this save.
