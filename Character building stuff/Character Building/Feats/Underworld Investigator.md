# Underworld Investigator
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your work as an investigator makes you familiar with the criminal element. You might be a criminal yourself, or you might have gained an understanding of how they operate from the outside.

You become trained in Underworld Lore, and you gain your [[Pursue a Lead]] circumstance bonus to Thievery checks to investigate the subject of your lead (such as checks to Steal a clue from a suspect or Pick a Lock to open a safe with damning documents).
