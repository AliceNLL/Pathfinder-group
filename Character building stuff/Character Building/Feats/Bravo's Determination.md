**Trigger** A foe's Strike reduces you to 0 Hit Points; you were not at 1 Hit Point and you would not be killed.

* * *

Your confidence borders on self-delusion, but it keeps you going against overwhelming odds. Attempt a Deception check against the attack DC of the triggering Strike. You take a penalty to this check equal to twice your wounded value, if any. If the triggering attack was a critical hit, use the result one degree of success worse than what you rolled.

* * *

**Critical Success** You avoid being knocked out and remain at 1 Hit Point.

**Success** You avoid being knocked out and remain at 1 Hit Point, but you increase your [[Wounded]] value by 1.
