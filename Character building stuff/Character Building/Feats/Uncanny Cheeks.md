# Uncanny Cheeks
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You squirrel away useful objects and seem to retrieve them at just the right time. You gain the [[Prescient Consumable]] and [[Prescient Planner]] feats, except that you always withdraw the objects from your cheek pouches. This means the object you retrieve must fit in your cheek pouches; this is generally an item of negligible Bulk unless you also have the [[Cheek Pouches]] feat.
