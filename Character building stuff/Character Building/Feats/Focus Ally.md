# Focus Ally
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** An adjacent ally fails, but doesn't critically fail, a saving throw against an effect with the incapacitation trait.

* * *

You're so focused on your allies that you can help them to recenter when something would take them out of the fight. Your ally rerolls the failed saving throw. That ally must take the second result.
