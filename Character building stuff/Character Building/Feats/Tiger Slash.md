# Tiger Slash
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** You are in [[Tiger Stance]]

* * *

You make a fierce swipe with both hands. Make a tiger claw Strike. It deals two extra weapon damage dice (three extra dice if you're 14th level or higher), and you can push the target 5 feet away as if you had successfully [[Shove|Shoved]] them.

If the attack is a critical success and deals damage, add your Strength modifier to the persistent bleed damage from your tiger claw.
