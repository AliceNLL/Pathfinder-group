# Future Spell Learning
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

More future memories of time magic percolate back to the present, teaching you spells you've yet to learn. Add _[[Behold the Weave]]_, _[[Cast into Time]]_, _[[Haste]]_, _[[Loose Time's Arrow]]_, _[[Quicken Time]]_, _[[Slow]]_, and _[[Stagnate Time]]_ to your spell list. You can thus potentially learn these spells even if they aren't normally on your tradition's spell list.
