# Disruptive Stance
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

The slightest distraction can provoke your wrath, and you're prepared to foil enemies' actions. As long as you are in this stance, you can use [[Reactive Strike]] when a creature within your reach uses a concentrate action, in addition to manipulate and move actions. Furthermore, you disrupt a triggering concentrate or manipulate action if your Strike hits (not only if it's a critical hit).
