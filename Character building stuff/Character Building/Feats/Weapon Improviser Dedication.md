# Weapon Improviser Dedication
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You don't take the normal -2 penalty to attack rolls with improvised weapons. Additionally, whenever you gain a class feature that grants you expert or greater proficiency with any weapon, you also gain that proficiency with improvised weapons.

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the [[Weapon Improviser]] archetype.
