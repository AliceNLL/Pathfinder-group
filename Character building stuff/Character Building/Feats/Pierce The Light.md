# Pierce The Light
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You tear the veil between the Universe and its shadow. You can cast _[[Interplanar Teleport]]_ twice per week as an occult innate spell that can only target yourself; you can travel only to the Universe or Netherworld, and your body serves as the focus component.
