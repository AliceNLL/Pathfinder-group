# Hydraulic Maneuvers
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You batter your foes with a torrent of water siphoned from your surroundings.

If the next action you take is an Athletics check to [[Disarm]], [[Shove]], or [[Trip]], that action has a range of 15 feet. You don't receive any item bonuses to that check or any circumstance bonuses related to your physical body, but if you roll a critical failure on that Athletics check, you get a failure instead.
