# Combination Finisher
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You combine a series of attacks with a powerful finishing blow. Your finishers' Strikes have a lower multiple attack penalty: -4 (or -3 with an agile weapon) if it's the second attack on your turn, or -8 (or -6 with an agile weapon) if it's the third or subsequent attack on your turn, instead of -5 and -10, respectively.
