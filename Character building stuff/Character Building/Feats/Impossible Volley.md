# Impossible Volley
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** You are wielding a ranged weapon with the volley trait and reload 0.

* * *

You fire a volley at all foes in an area. Make one Strike with a â€“2 penalty against each enemy within a 10 foot burst centered at or beyond your weapon's volley range. Roll the damage only once for all targets.

Each attack counts toward your multiple attack penalty, but do not increase your penalty until you have made all your attacks.
