# Enchanting Arrow
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

With a single whisper carried on the wind, you enchant your ammunition to make a foe more vulnerable to your attacks.

Make a bow Strike. On a hit, the target takes an additional 2d6 mental damage. On a critical hit, the target also becomes [[Stunned 1]]. The mental damage increases to 3d6 if your bow has a _greater striking_ rune, or to 4d6 if your bow has a _major striking_ rune.
