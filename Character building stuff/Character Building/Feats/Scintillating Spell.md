# Scintillating Spell
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your spells become a radiant display of light and color. If your next action is to Cast a Spell that doesn't have the darkness trait, has no duration, and requires creatures to attempt a Reflex save, the spell explodes in a spray of scintillating lights, in addition to its other effects. Each creature that failed its Reflex save against the spell is [[Dazzled]] for 1 round, and those who critically failed are instead [[Blinded]] for 1 round.
