# Skeletal Resistance
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your body becomes resistant, your hardened bones deflecting weapons and other forms of damage. You gain resistance 2 to cold, electricity, fire, piercing, and slashing damage. This resistance increases to 3 at 13th level and 4 at 17th level.
