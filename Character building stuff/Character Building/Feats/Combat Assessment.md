# Combat Assessment
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You make a telegraphed attack to learn about your foe. Make a melee Strike. On a hit, you can immediately attempt a check to [[Recall Knowledge]] about the target. On a critical hit, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the check to Recall Knowledge. The target is temporarily immune to Combat Assessment for 1 day.
