# Rupture Stomp
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Frequency** once per day

**Requirements** You are in Tenacious Stance.

* * *

Every dwarf knows that the rock they walk upon can be either a best friend or a treacherous path. With a heavy impact of your armored heel, you crack the ground underneath you. The ground within a 10 foot emanation becomes difficult terrain. If you are a master or better in the armor you are wearing, this becomes greater difficult terrain. The cracked ground settles and reverts to normal terrain after 1 minute.

**Special** At 16th level, you can take this feat again. If you do, you can use it once per hour instead of once per day.
