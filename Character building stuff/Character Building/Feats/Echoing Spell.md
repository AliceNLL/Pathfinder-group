# Echoing Spell
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You time the components of your spell with exacting precision, setting up a resonance that duplicates the spell's effects.

If your next action is to [[Cast a Spell]] of 4th level or lower that has no duration, the spell's energy reverberates and echoes. You can Cast the Spell a second time before the end of your next turn without expending a spell slot.
