# Reactive Shield
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** An enemy hits you with a melee Strike.

* * *

**Requirements** You are wielding a shield. You can snap your shield into place just as you would take a blow, avoiding the hit at the last second. You immediately use the [[Raise a Shield]] action and gain your shield's bonus to AC. The circumstance bonus from the shield applies to your AC when you're determining the outcome of the triggering attack.
