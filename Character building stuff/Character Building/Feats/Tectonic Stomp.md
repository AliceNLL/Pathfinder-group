# Tectonic Stomp
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You cause minor tremors that topple your enemies. All creatures in a 30 foot emanation who are standing on the ground take 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 2 levels you have, with a DC resolve reflex save. A creature that fails its save also falls [[Prone]].

**Awakening** Your stomp also ejects large fragments from the ground. You raise up to three stone chunks from the ground in unoccupied squares in the emanation; the stones can't be adjacent to one another. The chunks are 5 feet tall, block movement, and are large enough to [[Take Cover]] behind. They have AC 10, Hardness 8, and Hit Points equal to your level. They are immune to critical hits and precision damage. A stone chunk crumbles away when it has 0 Hit Points, and all of them crumble after 1 minute or when you use Tectonic Stomp again.

* * *

**Awakening** Your stomp rattles those who fail horribly. A creature that critically fails its save is also [[Stunned 1]].
