# Call Gun
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You build a powerful magical connection with a chosen gun or crossbow, gaining the ability to conjure it directly to your hand from any distant location. During your daily preparations, choose a single crossbow or firearm. Until your next daily preparations, you can use the [[Call Gun]] action to call the gun to your hand.
