# Magic Rider
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your people used powerful magic to travel between distant worlds in the distant past, and the remnants of that magic make such transportation easier for you. When you are the target of a teleportation spell that transports more than one person, it can affect an additional person beyond the normal limit, chosen by the caster. Additionally, when you're the target of a [[Teleport]] spell, you and the other targets arrive no farther than 1 mile off target, regardless of distance traveled.
