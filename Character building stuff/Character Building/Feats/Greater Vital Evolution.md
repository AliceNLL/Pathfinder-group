# Greater Vital Evolution
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Vital power surges through you like a font of energy. Twice per day, you can cast a spell after you've run out of spell slots of the appropriate spell level; the two spells you cast with this feat must be of different spell levels.
