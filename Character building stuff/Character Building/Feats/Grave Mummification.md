# Grave Mummification
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Exposure to the elements, magic, alchemy, and other phenomena intensified the changes from your mummification. You gain the [[Advanced Undead Benefits]].

In addition, you gain resistance equal to half your level against any damage you'd take from your bound terrain, including its dangerous temperatures, weather, hazardous terrain, and environmental hazards.
