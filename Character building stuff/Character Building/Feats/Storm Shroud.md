# Storm Shroud
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Frequency** once per hour

* * *

You become surrounded by a swirling storm of rain, sand, snow, or clouds, whichever of those suits your bound terrain. This activity has traits appropriate to the storm you create-typically earth for sand and water for rain, snow, or clouds. You become [[Concealed]] for 1 minute. You can't use this concealment to Hide or [[Sneak]], as normal for concealment that makes your position obvious.
