# Wandering Thoughts
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Frequency** once per round

**Requirements** You used your most recent action to [[Cast a Spell]].

* * *

When your Psyche is Unleashed, each burst of magic you cast also folds space around you, and you travel through one of those folds. You teleport 15 feet to a square you can see.
