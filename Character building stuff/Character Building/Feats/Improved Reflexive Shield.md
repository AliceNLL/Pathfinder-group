# Improved Reflexive Shield
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your shield can help save nearby allies. When you use [[Shield Block]] against damage resulting from a Reflex save, adjacent allies who would take damage due to Reflex saves against the same effect also benefit from the damage reduction.
