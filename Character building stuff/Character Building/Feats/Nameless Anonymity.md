# Nameless Anonymity
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your mask protects you further from divination. Once per day, you can cast _[[Veil of Privacy]]_ on yourself, heightened to the highest level of spell you can cast; the spell ends immediately if your mask is removed for even a moment. The spell is of the same tradition as your focus spells.
