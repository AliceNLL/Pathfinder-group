# Startling Appearance (Vigilante)
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** You are completely unnoticed by the target creature.

* * *

You can startle foes who are unaware of your presence. Make a Strike against your target. That creature is [[Off-Guard]] against this Strike, as normal. If your Strike hits, the target remains off-guard for the rest of your turn and is [[Frightened|Frightened 1]] (frightened 2 on a critical hit).
