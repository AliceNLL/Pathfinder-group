# Greater Distracting Shot
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Even a single missile can throw off your enemy's balance, and more powerful attacks leave it flustered for longer. If you hit your hunted prey with a ranged weapon, it's [[Off-Guard]] until the start of your next turn. If you critically hit your prey or hit it twice on the same turn with a ranged weapon, it's off-guard until the end of your next turn instead.
