# Improvise Tool
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You can jury-rig solutions when you don't have the proper tools on hand. You can attempt to [[Repair]] damaged items without a repair kit.

If you have the raw materials available, you can [[Craft]] a basic [[Caltrops|Caltrop]] set, [[Candle]], [[Compass]], [[Crowbar]], [[Fishing Tackle]], [[Flint and Steel]], [[Hammer]], [[Ladder (10-foot)|Ladder]], [[Piton]], [[Rope]], [[Ten-Foot Pole]], [[Thieves' Toolkit (Replacement Picks)|Replacement Thieves Picks]], [[Tool (Long)|Long Tool]] or [[Tool (Short)|Short Tool]], or [[Torch]] without consulting a basic crafter's book.
