# Bullseye
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You carefully take aim to avoid your foe's concealment and cover. On your next Strike with a thrown weapon before the end of your turn, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your attack roll and ignore your target's [[Concealed]] condition, as well as the target's lesser cover or standard cover; if the target had greater cover, they instead have only standard cover against the Strike.
