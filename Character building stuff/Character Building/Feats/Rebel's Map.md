# Rebel's Map
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** You roll initiative.

* * *

Rebellions require an intricate knowledge of one's surroundingsâ€”because you might need to escape at any moment. You remember the locations of escape routes, ambush spots, and cover from a scouting expedition or a previous visit to the area. Roll a d20. At any point during the subsequent combat, you can substitute the result of this roll instead of rolling a d20 on one Deception check to [[Create a Diversion]] or on one Stealth check to [[Hide]].
