# Nimble Strike
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You're cunning enough to find an opening in an opponent's attack. When you use your [[Nimble Dodge]] reaction, you can make a melee Strike against the triggering creature. This Strike doesn't count toward your multiple attack penalty, and your multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike. If you use the [[Nimble Roll]] feat, you can make this Strike at any point during your roll.
