# Lost in the Crowd
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You've learned how to move as one with crowds and hide among them, vanishing into a busy street in the blink of an eye. You move at full Speed in crowds and can use cover from crowds to Hide and Sneak, gaining a +2 circumstance bonus on your Stealth checks when in a crowd of at least 10 creatures and a +4 circumstance bonus on your Stealth checks when in a crowd of at least 100 creatures.
