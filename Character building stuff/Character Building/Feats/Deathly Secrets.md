# Deathly Secrets
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

No means of creating or ruling the undead is beyond your grasp, even those of magical traditions not your own. You learn either the _[[Eyes of the Dead]]_ or _[[Subjugate Undead]]_ focus spell. If you don't already have one, you gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point, which you can Refocus by meditating over the earthly remains of a dead sentient creature. Focus spells granted by the reanimator archetype are from the same tradition as those used to meet the archetype's prerequisite.

**Special** You can select this feat more than once. Each time, you learn a different spell and your focus pool increases by 1 Focus Point.
