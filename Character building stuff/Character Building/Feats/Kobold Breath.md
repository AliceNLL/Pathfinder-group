# Kobold Breath
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You channel your draconic exemplar's power into a gout of energy that manifests as a 30 foot line or a 15 foot cone, dealing 1d4 damage. Each creature in the area must attempt a basic saving throw against the higher of your class DC or spell DC. You can't use this ability again for 1d4 rounds.

At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, the damage increases by 1d4. The shape of the breath, the damage type, and the saving throw match those of your [[Draconic Exemplar]]. This ability has the trait associated with the type of damage it deals.
