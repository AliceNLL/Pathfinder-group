# Devrin's Cunning Stance
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You've learned Devrin Arlos's guileful ways, and his sly teachings help you remind your allies to keep their wits about them. When you use this action, attempt a deception check. The DC is usually a standard-difficulty DC of your level, but the GM can assign a different DC based on the circumstances. The effect depends on the result of your check.

* * *

**Critical Success** Your marshal's aura increases to a 20 foot emanation, and it grants you and your allies a +1 status bonus to skill checks. When you or an ally in the aura Strike an [[Off-Guard]] enemy, that enemy can't use reactions until the beginning of its next turn.

**Success** As critical success, but your aura's size doesn't increase.

**Failure** You fail to enter the stance.

**Critical Failure** You fail to enter the stance and can't take this action again for 1 minute.
