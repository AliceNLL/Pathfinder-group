# Wild Strider
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Natural obstacles pose no obstacle to you. You gain the ranger's [[Unimpeded Journey|Wild Stride]] class feature. This allows you to ignore the effects of all non-magical difficult terrain, treat greater difficult terrain as merely difficult terrain, and gives you an additional benefit from [[Favored Terrain]] based on the terrain.
