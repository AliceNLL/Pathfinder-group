# Eclectic Sword Mastery
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You instinctively learn how to use a sword with just a few practice swings. You change one of the swords designated in your [[Tengu Weapon Familiarity]] to a new one that you're wielding, provided the sword meets the specifications of Tengu Weapon Familiarity. You can Interact to draw a sword as part of this activity, designating the sword as part of drawing it; disrupting that Interact action prevents you from designating it as one of your swords. This designation lasts until your next daily preparations.
