# Greater Despair
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You increase the frequency of [[Mummy's Despair]] to once per 10 minutes instead of once per hour. A creature that critically fails its Will saving throw is [[Paralyzed]] for 1 round instead of [[Frightened|Frightened 2]]. Mummy's Despair gains the incapacitation trait.
