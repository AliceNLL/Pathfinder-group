# Shared Warding
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You ward your allies from the attacks of your foes whenever you apply those protections to yourself. When you gain a status bonus to AC and saves from Esoteric Warden, you can choose to grant the same benefit to all allies within 30 feet.
