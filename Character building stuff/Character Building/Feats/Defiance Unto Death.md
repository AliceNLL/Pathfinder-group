You loathe the alghollthus and their mind magic, and you've been trained to be willing to die rather than give into mental manipulation. If you would start your turn [[Confused]], [[Controlled]], or [[Fleeing]] due to a failed Will save, you can attempt a Will save against the same DC; on a success, you become [[Paralyzed]] until your next turn, rather than act against your will.
