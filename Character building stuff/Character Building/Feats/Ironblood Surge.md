# Ironblood Surge
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** You are in [[Ironblood Stance]]

* * *

You steel yourself, preparing to resist oncoming attacks and using your muscles to absorb the impact.

You gain the benefits of your iron sweep's parry trait (a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of your next turn) and your resistance from Ironblood Stance increases to your Strength modifier (if it's higher) for the same duration.
