# Staggering Blow
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** You're riding a megafauna companion that has a melee Strike.

* * *

You've trained your megafauna companion to stagger its enemies, impeding their ability to fight back. You [[Command an Animal]] to order your megafauna companion to spend both its actions making a single, powerful Strike. The attack deals an extra die of weapon damage, and if the attack hits and deals damage, the target is [[Slowed]] until the end of its next turn.
