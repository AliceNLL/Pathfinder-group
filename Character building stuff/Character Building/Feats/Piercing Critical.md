# Piercing Critical
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your attacks with your preferred weapons deal especially devastating wounds. When you Strike with a firearm or crossbow for which you have legendary proficiency, you critically succeed if you roll a 19 on the die, as long as that result is a success.
