# Giant Snare
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You can create bigger snares for quick deployment, making it more likely for a creature to walk into your snares.

When you prepare snares for quick deployment, you can prepare some of them as giant snares. A giant snare takes up a 10-foot-by-10-foot area but costs two of your quick deployment snares. A giant snare can trigger from a creature entering any portion of its area, and all its effects apply over the full area.
