# Visual Fidelity
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You've found a way to use a hodgepodge combination of devices to enhance your visual abilities in every situation. You gain darkvision and low-light vision, and you can see [[Invisible]] creatures and objects as translucent shapes, though these shapes are indistinct enough to be [[Concealed]] to you.

If an effect would give you the [[Blinded]] condition, the effect must attempt a counteract check against your class DC, with your counteract level equaling half your level, rounded up. On a failed counteract check, you aren't blinded-your various devices are able to compensate.
