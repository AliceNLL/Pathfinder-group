# Malleable Form
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** You're polymorphed by a spell that has multiple choices of battle form.

* * *

You adroitly shift your form, taking on another appearance. Choose a different battle form of the polymorph spell affecting you, and change to that form instead of the current one. This destabilizes the spell's magic, reducing its duration by 1 round. Use the level of the spell to determine the statistics, as normal.
