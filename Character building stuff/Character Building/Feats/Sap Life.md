# Sap Life
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

ou draw the life force out of your enemies. When you cast a [[Harm]] spell and damage at least one living creature, you regain Hit Points equal to the spell rank of your _harm_ spell. If you aren't a living creature, you gain no benefit from this feat.
