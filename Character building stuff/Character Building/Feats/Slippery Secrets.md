# Slippery Secrets
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You elude and evade attempts to uncover your true nature or intentions. When a spell or magical effect tries to read your mind, detect whether you are lying, or reveal your identity, you can attempt a Deception check against the spell or effect's DC. If you succeed, the effect reveals nothing.
