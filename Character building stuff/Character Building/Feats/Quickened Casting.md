**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Bard** If your next action is to cast a bard cantrip or a bard spell that is at least 2 ranks lower than the highest-rank bard spell slot you have, reduce the number of actions to cast it by 1 (minimum 1 action).

**Witch** You accelerate your spellcasting. If your next action is to cast a witch cantrip or a witch spell that is at least 2 ranks lower than the highest-rank witch spell slot you have, reduce the number of actions to cast it by 1 (minimum 1 action).

**Wizard** Straining your mind, you collapse as much of your spell's formulas as you can, resulting in a shorter but much more complex incantation. If your next action is to cast a wizard cantrip or a wizard spell that is at least 2 ranks lower than the highest-rank wizard spell slot you have, reduce the number of actions to cast it by 1 (minimum 1 action).

**Others** If your next action is to cast a class cantrip or a class spell that is at least 2 levels lower than the highest-level class spell slot you have, reduce the number of actions to cast it by 1 (minimum 1 action).
