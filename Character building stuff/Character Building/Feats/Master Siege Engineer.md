# Master Siege Engineer
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

What you don't know about artillery isn't worth knowing and your mastery allows you to perform an impossible number of actions as part of a siege weapon's crew. You're permanently [[Quickened]]. You can only use the extra action to Aim or Launch a siege weapon.
