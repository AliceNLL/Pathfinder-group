# Wild Winds Initiate
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You learn a mystical stance that lets you attack from a distance. You gain the _[[Wild Winds Stance]]_ ki spell. Increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1.

While entering the stance is a ki spell, the wind crash Strikes the stance grants are not, so you can use them as often as you like while in the stance.
