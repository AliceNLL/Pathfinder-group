# Eagle Eyes

You and your spotter are adept at watching out for one another. As long as you can see or hear each other, neither of you is [[Off-Guard]] to [[Hidden]], undetected, or flanking creatures of your level or lower, or to creatures of your level or lower using a surprise attack. However, they can still help their allies flank.
