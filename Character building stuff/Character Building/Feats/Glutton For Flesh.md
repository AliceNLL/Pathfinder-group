# Glutton For Flesh
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You have developed a capacity to store more flesh within your gaunt body to leave yourself satiated longer. If you [[Consume Flesh]] while satiated, you become fully satiated. You stay fully satiated for 3 hours, after which you become satiated for 1 hour. If you're fully satiated when an ability would end your satiation, you cease being fully satiated but remain satiated. If you have [[Grave Strength]], you gain a +10-foot status bonus to your Speed when fully satiated instead of a +5-foot status bonus for being satiated.
