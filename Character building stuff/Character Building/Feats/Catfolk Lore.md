# Catfolk Lore
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Growing up among catfolk has taught you the traditional values of freedom to travel, stewardship of the land, and quick reactions when your curiosity lands you in trouble.

You gain the trained proficiency rank in Acrobatics and Survival. If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in Catfolk Lore.

_Note: If you are already trained in the skill provided by this feat, you need to manually select an alternative skill. You also need to manually enter the granted Lore skill._
