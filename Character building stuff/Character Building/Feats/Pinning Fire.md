# Pinning Fire
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** You use [[Flurry of Blows]] to make two ranged piercing weapon Strikes against the same target.

* * *

You target your opponent's clothing, equipment, or loose flesh with piercing projectiles to pin them to the ground or a nearby surface.

If both your attacks hit, the target must succeed at a Reflex save against your class DC or become [[Immobilized]] until it or an adjacent creature succeeds at a DC 10 athletics check to remove the pinning projectiles.

The creature doesn't become stuck if it is incorporeal, is liquid (like a water elemental or some oozes), or could otherwise escape without effort.
