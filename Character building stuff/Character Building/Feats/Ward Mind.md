# Ward Mind
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** You're currently affected by a mental effect that you gained by failing, but not critically failing, a saving throw.

**Trigger** Your turn ends.

* * *

To protect the knowledge within your mind from intrusion or erasure, you ward yourself against a mental attack, temporarily delaying its effects. Until the end of your next turn, you ignore a single mental effect that meets the requirement. You can suppress a particular effect using Ward Mind or Cognitive Loophole only once, even if you have both feats.

* * *

**Special** You can use this reaction even if the mental effect prevents you from using reactions.
