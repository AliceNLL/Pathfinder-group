# Esoteric Warden
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

When you apply antithetical material against a creature successfully, you also ward yourself against its next attacks. When you succeed at your check to Exploit a Vulnerability, you gain a +1 status bonus to your AC against the creature's next attack and a +1 status bonus to your next saving throw against the creature; if you critically succeed, these bonuses are +2 instead. You can gain these bonuses only once per day against a particular creature, and the benefit ends if you Exploit Vulnerability again.
