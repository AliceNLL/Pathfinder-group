# Pristine Weapon
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your verdant weapon can cut through the resistances of magical creatures. The weapon is treated as cold iron and silver. If you critically hit a creature that has a weakness to cold iron or silver, the target takes 1d6 bleed damage as the primal energies within your weapon slow its natural healing.
