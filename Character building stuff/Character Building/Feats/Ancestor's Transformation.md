# Ancestor's Transformation
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You can commune with ancestor spirits to assume the form of an enormous primeval strix. You can cast 5th-level _[[Aerial Form]]_ as a primal innate spell once per day, but you take the form of a primeval strix, using the statistics for a bird form.
