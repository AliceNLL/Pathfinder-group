# Second Wind
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You can enter a second rage, but afterward you need to catch your breath. You can Rage without waiting for 1 minute after the previous Rage (or 1 round, with quick rage), but when you end this second Rage, you're [[Fatigued]] until you rest for 10 minutes.
