# Cast Down
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

The sheer force of your faith can bring a foe crashing down. If the next action you use is to cast [[Harm]] or [[Heal]] to damage one creature, the target is knocked [[Prone]] if it takes any damage from the spell. If the target critically fails its save against the spell, it also takes a â€“10-foot status penalty to its Speed for 1 minute.
