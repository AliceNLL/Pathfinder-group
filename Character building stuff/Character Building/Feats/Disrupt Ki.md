# Disrupt Ki
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Make an unarmed Strike. If it deals damage to a living creature, you block that creature's inner life force.

The creature takes 2d6 persistent,void damage and is [[Enfeebled 1]] until the persistent damage ends.

If you're 18th level or higher, this deals 3d6 persistent,void damage instead.
