# Master Skysage Divination
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You unlock the most powerful secrets hidden in the stars above. You learn a 7th-level spell from any spell list. At 18th level, you learn an 8th-level spell, and at 20th level, you learn a 9th-level spell. Each of these spells must come from the divination school. You gain master proficiency with spell attack rolls and spell DCs for occult spells.
