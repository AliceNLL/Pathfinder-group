# Cultural Adaptability
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

During your adventures, you've honed your ability to adapt to the culture of the predominant ancestry around you. You gain the [[Adopted Ancestry]] general feat, and you also gain one 1st-level ancestry feat from the ancestry you chose for the Adopted Ancestry feat.
