# Eerie Environs
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

The natural world can be scary to those not used to it-and you make it scarier still. If you're [[Hidden]] from a creature, you can attempt to [[Demoralize]] it without losing your hidden condition-imitating the sounds of strange beasts or causing the foliage to rustle menacingly. When you do so, you don't take a penalty to your check if the target doesn't understand your language.
