# Bone Caller
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Using a mixture of dinosaur bones and the bones of your ancestors to focus your magic, you animate lizards and dinosaurs to carry messages or serve as mounts. You can cast _[[Animal Messenger]]_ and _[[Marvelous Mount]]_ as primal innate spells once per day each. The animal messenger is always a Tiny dinosaur or lizard, and your innate spell transforms it from bones to flesh, even if there are no dinosaurs or lizards nearby. The phantom steed looks like a dinosaur rather than a horse but functions identically.
