# Daring Flourish
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You make quick use of an opening from your daring stunts. At the end of a successful Daring Act, you can make a melee Strike against the target or attempt to [[Disarm]] the target. The target is [[Off-Guard]] against the Strike you make during Daring Act as well as the next melee attack you attempt against it before the end of your turn.
