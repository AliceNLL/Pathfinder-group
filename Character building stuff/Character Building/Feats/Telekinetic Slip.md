# Telekinetic Slip
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** Your turn begins, and you're [[Grabbed]] or [[Restrained]].

* * *

A thin shell of telekinetic energy pushes from your skin, widening your enemy's grasp enough for you to slip free. You gain a +2 status bonus to checks to [[Escape]] from whatever has you grabbed or restrained. This bonus lasts until either you're no longer grabbed or restrained, or you fall [[Unconscious]].
