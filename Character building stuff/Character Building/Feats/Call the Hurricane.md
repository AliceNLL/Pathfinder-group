# Call the Hurricane
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Massive waves spiral around you, with you as the eye of the hurricane. The waves appear in a 20 foot emanation, or a 30 foot emanation if you're in a body of water. Each creature in the area takes 6d8 bludgeoning  damage with a DC resolve reflex save against your class DC. A creature that fails its save is battered by the waves and pushed 10 feet (or 20 feet on a critical failure).

* * *

**Level (+2)** The damage increases by 1d8.
