# Eye For Treasure
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You know good artisanship when you see it and can wax poetic about crafting techniques and forms.

You become trained in Crafting and gain a +1 circumstance bonus on all Crafting checks made to [[Recall Knowledge]]. If you would automatically become trained in Crafting (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice.

In addition, you gain the [[Crafter's Appraisal]] skill feat, enabling you to identify magic items using the Crafting skill.
