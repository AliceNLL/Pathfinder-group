# Stunning Fist
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

The focused power of your flurry threatens to overwhelm your opponent. When you target the same creature with two Strikes from your [[Flurry of Blows]], you can try to stun the creature. If either Strike hits and deals damage, the target must succeed at a Fortitude save against your class DC or be [[Stunned 1]] (or [[Stunned 1|Stunned 3]] on a critical failure). This is an incapacitation effect.
