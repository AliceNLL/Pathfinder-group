# Trapsmith Dedication
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You use glimmering gears and gnashing mechanisms to manufacture snares using specialized parts. Your snares include clockwork and steam-powered cogwheels and gears, and their gush of steam can hinder those you ensnare. If you choose to construct a snare using gears and a creature fails their saving throw against the snare, all creatures are concealed to that creature for 1 round, as a burst of steam obscures its vision.

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the [[Snarecrafter]] or [[Trapsmith]] archetypes.
