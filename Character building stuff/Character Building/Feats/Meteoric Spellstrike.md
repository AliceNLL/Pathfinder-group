# Meteoric Spellstrike
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** You're wielding a ranged or thrown weapon, or have a ranged unarmed attack.

* * *

A trail of energy flows from your target back to you. Make a Spellstrike with a ranged weapon or ranged unarmed attack against a target within the ranged weapon or unarmed attack's first range increment. The spell you cast for the Spellstrike can't be a cantrip or focus spell. Each creature in a line between you and the target, excluding you and the target, takes damage equal to double the spell's level. Determine the damage type as described in Arcane Cascade.
