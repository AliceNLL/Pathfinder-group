# Symphony of the Muse
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You have learned how to weave countless performances together into a solo symphony with multitudinous effects. You are no longer limited to a single composition each turn or a single composition at a time; when you use a new composition, all previous compositions' effects continue for their remaining duration.
