You discard a disguise and dramatically reveal your true identity, catching your foes off guard. If you created your disguise using magic such as with _[[Humanoid Form]]_ or _[[Illusory Disguise]]_, you immediately Dismiss the spell as a free action. Stride up to your speed and attempt a Deception check to [[Feint]] one target within 30 feet. If you succeed, you roll twice and take the better result on your first attack roll against that target this turn.
