# Telluric Power
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You channel strength from the earth beneath your feet to pummel your enemies. When making a melee Strike against a target who is standing on the same earth or stone surface as you are, you gain a circumstance bonus to the damage roll equal to the number of weapon damage dice.
