# Magic Hands
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

The blessing of your deity heightens your healing ability, integrating magical healing with the mundane. When you succeed at a Medicine check to [[Treat Wounds]], you can roll d10s instead of d8s for the healing and add a status bonus to the healing equal to your level.
