You refine your halcyon magic. You gain two common 4th-level halcyon spells and two 5th-level halcyon spells. You also gain a 4th-level halcyon spell slot and a 5th-level halcyon spell slot. Your proficiency rank in either arcane or primal spell DCs and spell attack rolls advances from trained to expert.
