# Necromantic Resistance (Undead Slayer)
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

As part of your training, you've inured yourself against necromancy through grueling, repeated exposure. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saves against necromancy effects and gain resistance to void damage equal to half your level.
