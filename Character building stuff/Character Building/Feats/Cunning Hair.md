# Cunning Hair
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your hair moves under your control. You can perform simple [[Interact]] actions with your hair, such as opening an unlocked door. Your hair can't perform actions that require fingers or significant manual dexterity, including any action that would require a check to accomplish, and you can't use it to hold items.
