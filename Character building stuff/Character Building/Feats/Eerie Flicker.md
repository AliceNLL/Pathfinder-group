# Eerie Flicker
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** An enemy's Strike would hit you and you weren't already [[Concealed]], [[Hidden]], or [[Undetected]] by that enemy.

* * *

Your body flickers momentarily into the Ethereal Plane. You become concealed for 1 round, and the flat check for concealment applies to the Strike that would have hit you. If the flat check fails, the Strike misses you.

* * *

**Awakening** When your body flickers, you momentarily assume a terrifying form. If a creature fails the flat check against concealment from your Eerie Flicker, it becomes [[Frightened|Frightened 1]], and it doesn't reduce the frightened condition from this effect at the end of the same turn it gained the condition.

* * *

**Awakening** You can choose to compress your flickering movement into a single moment, increasing your chance to avoid the triggering attack in exchange for a shorter-lived effect. If you choose to do so, the flat check for concealment against the triggering attack increases to DC 9 flat, but the concealment affects only the triggering Strike.
