# Experienced Harrower
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

When you perform the _[[Harrowing]]_ ritual, the DC for the Primary Check is never more than the standard DC by level, and the cost for the ritual is halved. If you use a fine harrow deck, the cost for the ritual is removed entirely.
