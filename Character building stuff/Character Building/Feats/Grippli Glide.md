# Grippli Glide
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** You must have at least one hand free.

* * *

You can use your webbed feet to guide your fall. You glide slowly toward the ground, 5 feet down (10 feet if you don't have both hands free) and up to 25 feet forward through the air. As long as you spend at least 1 action gliding each round and have not yet reached the ground, you remain in the air at the end of your turn.
