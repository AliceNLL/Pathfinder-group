# Lasting Doubt
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

When you cast doubt upon your foes, the effect lasts longer than usual.

After being enfeebled 2 by your [[Glimpse of Redemption]], the foe is enfeebled 1 for 1 minute.

If you have [[Weight of Guilt]], after being stupefied 2 by your Glimpse of Redemption, the foe is stupefied 1 for 1 minute or until the flat check from stupefied causes it to lose a spell, whichever comes first.
