# Dancing Leaf
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You are as light as a leaf whirling in the breeze. When you [[Leap]] or succeed at a [[High Jump]] or [[Long Jump]], increase the distance you jump by 5 feet. When calculating the damage you take from falling, don't count any distance fallen while you are adjacent to a wall.
