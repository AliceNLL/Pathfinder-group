# Catrina's Presence
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You've adopted the calming presence of catrinas, the festive dead; you might have even danced with a catrina yourself! So long as you are visibly carrying fresh flowers or colorful ribbons somewhere on your person, you can cast _[[Calm]]_ twice per day as a 2nd-level divine innate spell.
