# Shape of the Cloud Dragon
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You've discovered how to transform yourself into a cloud dragon. Once per day, you can cast 7th-level _[[Dragon Form]]_ as an innate arcane spell, transforming into a cloud dragon. The spell automatically heightens to 8th level if you're 16th level and 9th level if you're 18th level.

On a critical hit with an unarmed Strike gained from dragon form, you recharge the spell's breath weapon immediately.

While in this form, you gain the following cloud dragon-specific abilities:

*   **Cloud** cloud walk (you can walk on clouds or fog);
    *   **Melee** 1 jaws, **Damage** 2d10 piercing plus 1d12 electricity;
    *   **Melee** 1 claw (agile), **Damage** 3d10 slashing;
    *   **Melee** 1 tail (reach 10 feet), **Damage** 3d10 bludgeoning;
    *   **Melee** 1 horn (reach 10 feet), **Damage** 3d8 piercing;
    *   Breath Weapon 30 foot cone, 6d12 electricity.

* * *

**Special** You can use this feat in place of [[Shape Of The Dragon]] to fulfill feat requirements.
