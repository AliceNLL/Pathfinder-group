# Spirit's Anguish
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Cost** 1 spirit wisp or spirit remnant from your spirit dwelling

**Requirements** You are holding your spirit dwelling.

* * *

You purify a spirit by coaxing it to release its anguish in a final cathartic howl. This deals sonic damage to all creatures in a 30 foot cone, with a DC resolve will save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. If you expend a spirit wisp, this deals 1d4 sonic damage per level you have. If you expend a spirit remnant, this deals 1d6 sonic damage per level of the incorporeal undead or haunt from which you gained the remnant.
