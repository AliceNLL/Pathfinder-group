# Agile Maneuvers
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You easily maneuver against your foes. Your [[Grapple]], [[Shove]], and [[Trip]] actions have a lower multiple attack penalty: -4 instead of -5 if they're the second attack on your turn, or -8 instead of -10 if they're the third or subsequent attack on your turn.
