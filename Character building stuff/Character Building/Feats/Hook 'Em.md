![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** A rope is within your reach, or you have a rope or grappling weapon in your hand.

* * *

The Salt Breakers learned to use whatever they could during the Vidric Revolution, and they quickly mastered the art of making a rope into a useful tool in combat. You take hold of a nearby rope, throw a rope from your hand, or fire a grappling weapon at a solid surfaceâ€”and then swing up to twice your Speed. If you end your movement next to an enemy, attempt an Athletics check to [[Grapple]] that enemy, tying them up in your rope.
