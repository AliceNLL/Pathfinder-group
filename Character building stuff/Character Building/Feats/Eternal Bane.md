# Eternal Bane
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your life has made you a nexus for your deity's vile power. You're continuously surrounded by a [[Bane]] spell, with a spell rank equal to half your level (rounded up). The radius is 15 feet, and you can't increase it. You can Dismiss the spell; if you do, it returns automatically after 1 minute.
