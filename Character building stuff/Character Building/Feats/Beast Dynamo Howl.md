# Beast Dynamo Howl
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You've incorporated beast tech from Arcadia into your dynamo, adding in components from various terrifying creatures to enhance your prosthesis's capabilities. The beast parts can unleash a disturbing howl as you make a powerful attack with your dynamo. Attempt a single Intimidation check to Demoralize each enemy within 30 feet; you don't take a penalty when you attempt to Demoralize a creature that doesn't understand your language. Then, make a dynamo Strike. Reduce the operational time of your sterling dynamo by 1 hour.
