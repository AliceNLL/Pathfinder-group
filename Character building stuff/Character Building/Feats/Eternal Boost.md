# Eternal Boost
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your link with your eidolon is so intense that you continuously reinforce its abilities. You are permanently [[Quickened]]; you can use your extra action only to cast _boost eidolon_ or _reinforce eidolon_.

While in exploration mode, you can declare that you are also continually casting _boost eidolon_ or _reinforce eidolon_ even while using a different exploration activity. If you do, even before your first turn in a combat encounter, that cantrip is active as if you had cast it on your previous turn.
