# Tail Spin
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You excel at using your tail as a weapon to upend your foes. Attempt a single Athletics check to [[Trip]]  up to two adjacent creatures. If you roll a success against a target, you get a critical success against that target instead.
