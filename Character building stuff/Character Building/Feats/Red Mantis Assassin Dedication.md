# Red Mantis Assassin Dedication
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Access** You are from Mediogalti Island.

* * *

You have learned how to stalk your foes and slay them with a sawtooth sabre. You become trained in Stealth and Assassin Lore; if you were already trained, you become an expert instead. Whenever your proficiency in any weapon increases to expert or beyond, you also gain that new proficiency with [[Sawtooth Saber]].

* * *

**Special** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the [[Red Mantis Assassin]] archetype.
