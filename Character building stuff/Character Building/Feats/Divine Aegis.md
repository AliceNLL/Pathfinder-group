**Trigger** You attempt a saving throw against a magical effect, but you haven't rolled yet.

* * *

You summon divine energy to shield yourself, offering protection against other traditions but leaving you exposed to other divine effects.

Until the beginning of your next turn, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against non-divine magical effects, but you also take a -1 circumstance penalty to saves against divine effects.
