# Felling Shot
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your ranged attacks can shoot an unprepared foe right out of the air. Make a ranged Strike against an [[Off-Guard]] creature. If the Strike is a success and deals damage, the target must attempt a DC resolve reflex save against your class DC.

* * *

**Success** The target is unaffected.

**Failure** The target falls up to 120 feet. If it hits the ground, it takes no damage from the fall.

**Critical Failure** As failure, and the target can't fly, jump, levitate, or otherwise leave the ground until the end of your next turn.
