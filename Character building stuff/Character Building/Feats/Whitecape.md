# Whitecape
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You're shorter and wider than many vanaras of your heritage, and the hair on your shoulders and your head is particularly thick and luxurious, like a majestic cape. This hair grows back supernaturally quickly if shorn. You gain the [[Steady Balance]] skill feat, even if you aren't trained in Acrobatics, and you can Step into difficult terrain caused by uneven ground.

**Special** You can take this feat only at 1st level, and you can't retrain out of or into this feat.
