# Echoing Channel
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

When you pull forth vitality or void energy, you also create a smaller pocket of that energy. If the next action you use is to cast a 2-action [[Harm]] or [[Heal]] to heal or damage a single creature, choose one additional creature in range. Target that creature with a 1-action version of the same spell. This spell is the same rank as the 2-action _harm_ or _heal_ you cast and doesn't cost another spell slot.
