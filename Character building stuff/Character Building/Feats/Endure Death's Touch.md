# Endure Death's Touch
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** You are wearing medium or heavy armor in which you have expert proficiency.

**Trigger** An undead hits you with an unarmed attack.

* * *

Your conviction redirects the undead's attack through your armor and then harmlessly away. You gain resistance 5 to physical damage and resistance 10 to void damage against the triggering attack. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus on any saving throws against effects from the undead's natural attack; if you succeed at the saving throw, you get a critical success instead.
