# Sleek Reposition
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** You are wielding a finesse weapon or polearm.

* * *

While your opponent is still recovering from your prior attack, you snag its armor, clothing, or flesh to move it as you please. Make a melee Strike with a finesse weapon or polearm. If you hit a target that is your size or smaller, you can automatically [[Reposition]] it, with the same benefits as the Reposition action (including the critical success effect, if your Strike was a critical hit). If you used a weapon with reach, use the weapon's reach for this Reposition.

This Strike has the following failure effect.

**Failure** The target becomes [[Off-Guard]] until the end of your current turn.
