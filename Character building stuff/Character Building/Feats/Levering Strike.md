# Levering Strike
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** You are wielding your staff.

* * *

Make a Strike with your staff. As long as you don't critically fail, the target becomes [[Off-Guard]] and takes a -2 circumstance penalty to its DC against [[Shove]], [[Trip]], and [[Tumble Through]] attempts until the start of your next turn.
