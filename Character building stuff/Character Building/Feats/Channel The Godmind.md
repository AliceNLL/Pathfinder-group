# Channel The Godmind
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

You tap into the Godmind's collective cognitive well, rapidly parsing near-infinite variables to read your surroundings. For 1 minute, you gain precise motion sense out to 60 feet, you can see invisible creatures and objects, and you gain the effects of a 9th-level _[[Truesight]]_.
