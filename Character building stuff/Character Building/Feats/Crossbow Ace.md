# Crossbow Ace
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** You are wielding a crossbow with reload 1 or higher.

* * *

Your deep understanding of the crossbow allows you to reload efficiently while moving yourself out of the line of return fire. Either [[Create a Diversion]] or [[Take Cover]], then Interact to reload. As normal, you must meet the requirements to Take Cover; you must be [[Prone]], benefiting from cover, or near a feature that allows you to Take Cover.
