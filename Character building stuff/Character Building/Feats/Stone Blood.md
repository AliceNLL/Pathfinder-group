# Stone Blood
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You can selectively stop your bleeding with ease. Reduce the DC of flat checks to stop persistent bleed damage you have from 15 to 10, and you can use a single action that has the concentrate trait to gain an early flat check without physically binding the wounds. You recover naturally from the [[Drained 1|Drained]] condition twice as quickly as normal.
