# Tracing Sigil
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

When you cast sigil, you can modify the spell to add the following to its standard effects: The target leaves a magical trail that you and others can try to follow. You and other creatures can attempt to Track the target, substituting an Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion check (whichever matches the magical tradition of your sigil spell) for the Survival check. Much like Tracking with Survival, this must take place somewhere the target has been and follow the trail; it doesn't allow anyone to find the target from a distance. You can only have a single target marked with a modified sigil in this way. If you use this ability again on a second target, the sigil spell on the first target ends, and your mark fades.
