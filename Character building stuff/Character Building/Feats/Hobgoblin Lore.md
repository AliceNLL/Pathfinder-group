![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You've studied traditional hobgoblin exercises and fieldcraft, all of which have a militaristic bent. You become trained in Athletics and Crafting. For each of these skills in which you were already trained, you become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in Hobgoblin Lore.
