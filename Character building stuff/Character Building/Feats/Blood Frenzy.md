# Blood Frenzy
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** Your eidolon's last action dealt bleed damage to a living creature.

Your eidolon flies into a frenzy. It gains the benefits of _boost eidolon_ and gains temporary HP equal to your level, but takes a -2 penalty to AC. It can't voluntarily end the frenzy or start another frenzy while in the frenzy.

The frenzy lasts for 1 minute, after which your eidolon is [[Fatigued]] for 1 minute and can't start another frenzy for 1 minute.
