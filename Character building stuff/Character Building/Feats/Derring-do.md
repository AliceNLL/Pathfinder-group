# Derring-do
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

When you compound [[Panache]] with even more derring-do, it somehow tends to work out.

When you already have panache, you can roll twice and use the higher result on checks to which the circumstance bonus for having panache applies ([[Tumble Through]] and any skill actions listed in your swashbuckler's style).
