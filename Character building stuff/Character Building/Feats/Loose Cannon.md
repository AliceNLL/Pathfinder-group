# Loose Cannon
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your unpredictable gunfire often catches enemies off guard or hits unprotected areas. Make a ranged Strike with a firearm against a creature that you haven't already attacked on this turn. You gain a circumstance bonus to damage on this Strike equal to the number of weapon damage dice. The Strike gains the following failure effect.

* * *

**Failure** The firearm misfires, but it doesn't cause the other critical failure effects listed below.

**Critical Failure** The firearm misfires and also explodes. It becomes broken, and it deals its normal weapon damage to all creatures in a 20 foot burst centered on the firearm, with a DC resolve reflex against your class DC. This damage includes any from the weapon's fundamental and property runes.
