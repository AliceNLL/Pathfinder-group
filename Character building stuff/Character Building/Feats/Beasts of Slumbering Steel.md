# Beasts of Slumbering Steel
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You conjure metal elemental mounts made of interlocking metal pieces. Target up to 5 Medium or smaller willing creatures within 30 feet. Large mounts appear underneath them, and the targets can immediately [[Mount]] the creatures. Each mount can take four different forms. One form has only a land Speed of 80 feet, and the other forms each have a land Speed of 30 feet with a climb, fly, or swim Speed of 60 feet. Each rider chooses the initial form and can change the form as a single action, which has the concentration trait.

The mounts have AC 40, Fortitude +30, Reflex +30, Will +25, and 180 Hit Points. They're mindless and immune to bleed, healing, [[Paralyzed]], poison, and sleep. They can't attack. They remain for 1 minute or until you use this impulse again. You can use this impulse as a 1-minute exploration activity to make the duration 1 hour, but this halves the mounts' defenses and HP.
