![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** An enemy within 30 feet damages you or succeeds at a skill check.

* * *

Every Firebrand can recognize the skill of others, but you've turned it into an art you can wield in combat. You compliment a foe's form or technique, and your unexpected praise distracts them from their surroundings. Attempt a Diplomacy check against that enemy's Will DC. Regardless of your result, they are temporarily immune to your Grudging Compliments for 10 minutes.

**Critical Success** The target becomes [[Off-Guard]] for 1 round.

**Success** The target becomes off-guard against your attacks for 1 round.
