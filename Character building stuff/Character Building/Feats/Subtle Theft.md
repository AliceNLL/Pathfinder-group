# Subtle Theft
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

When you successfully [[Steal]] something, observers (creatures other than the creature you stole from) take a â€“2 circumstance penalty to their Perception DCs to detect your theft. Additionally, if you first [[Create a Diversion]] using Deception, taking a single Palm an Object or Steal action doesn't end your undetected condition.
