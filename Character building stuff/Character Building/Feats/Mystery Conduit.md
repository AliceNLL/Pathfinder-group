# Mystery Conduit
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

The power of your mystery enables you to cast more than just revelation spells.

When you cast a spell of 5th level or lower that has no duration, instead of spending a spell slot, you can advance the effects of your oracular curse in the same manner as when you cast a revelation spell. A spell cast in this way gains the cursebound trait.
