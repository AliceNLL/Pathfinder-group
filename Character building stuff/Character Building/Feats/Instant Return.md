# Instant Return
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** An enemy misses you with a ranged attack using a type of ammunition appropriate to your weapon (a bullet if you're wielding a firearm).

**Requirements** You're wielding an unloaded firearm or crossbow.

* * *

With a single fluid gesture, you catch a projectile out of the air, load it in your weapon, and shoot it back at the attacker. Interact to load the projectile into your weapon, then make a Strike with the required weapon against the triggering opponent. Since you're using the foe's ammunition, this Strike applies any special effects that ammunition would have (for instance, if it was [[Explosive Ammunition]], it would explode in a burst of fire if your Strike hits).
