![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** You have one or more hands free.

* * *

You infuse magical power into your body or armaments to parry both physical and magical assaults.

You raise your guard, gaining a +1 circumstance bonus to AC and to saving throws against spells that target you until the start of your next turn, as long as you continue to meet the requirements.
