# Marshal Dedication
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You've combined your social skills and combat training to become a talented combat leader. Choose Diplomacy or Intimidation. You become trained in that skill or become an expert if you were already trained in it.

In addition, you're surrounded by a marshal's aura in a 10 foot emanation. Your aura has the emotion, mental, and visual traits and grants you and allies within the aura a +1 status bonus to saving throws against fear.

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the [[Marshal]] archetype.
