# Head of the Night Parade
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You remember the revelry of the Night Parade and call them to your aid in a riotous display. You Perform and cast 8th-level _[[Mad Monkeys]]_ three times, except that the spell calls various apparitions such as dancing tsukumogami or drinking oni rather than monkeys. Each casting can produce a different kind of mischief. You can Sustain all three Spells each round using a single Perform action.
