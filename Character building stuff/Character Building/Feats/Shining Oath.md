# Shining Oath
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You've sworn an oath to put the undead to rest. You gain the following edict: "You must end the existence of undead you encounter as long as you have a reasonable chance of success; in the unlikely event you find an undead that isn't unholy, you can try to work out a more peaceful way to help it recover from its undead state rather than destroying it in combat, such as helping it complete its unfinished business and find peace."

Your [[Retributive Strike]] gains a +4 circumstance bonus to damage against an undead, or +6 if you have master proficiency with the weapon you used.

Your [[Glimpse of Redemption|Glimpse of Redemption's]] resistance against damage from an undead is 7 + your level.

If you use [[Liberating Step]] triggered by an undead, your ally gains a +4 circumstance bonus to checks granted by your Liberating Step, and the ally can Step twice afterward.

You don't consider undead to be legitimate authorities, even in nations ruled by undead.
