![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You're one of Hei Feng's chosen people and have the authority of the Celestial Court on your side. Once per day, you can cast a 6th-level _[[Spirit Blast]]_ as a divine innate spell. In addition, you gain resistance 5 to both good and evil damage.
