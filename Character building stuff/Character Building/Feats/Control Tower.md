Your keen senses and ability to process battlefield information have dramatically improved, allowing you to drastically reduce the advantage of unseen foes. You and allies in your overwatch field gain a +2 circumstance bonus when using the Seek action to find hidden or undetected creatures within the overwatch field. You and your allies don't have to succeed at a flat check to target a concealed creature within your overwatch field. When you or an ally targets a hidden creature in your overwatch field, reduce the DC of the flat check to 5.
