# Healing Transformation
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You can take advantage of shapechanging magic to close wounds and patch injuries. If your next action is to cast a non-cantrip polymorph spell that targets only one creature, your polymorph spell also restores 1d6 Hit Points per spell rank to that creature. This is a healing effect.
