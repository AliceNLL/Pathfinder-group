# Chosen of Lamashtu
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You bear the favor and blessings of [[Lamashtu]], the Mother of Monsters. She has bestowed a mutation upon you, granting you the benefits of another heritage. Choose one goblin heritage that you do not already have; you gain that heritage and its benefits.
