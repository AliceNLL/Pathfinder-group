# Starlit Eyes
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Starlight shines in your sight, enhancing your perception and range.

When you make a ranged Strike while in Arcane Cascade stance, you lower the DC of your flat check to target a creature that's [[Concealed]] or [[Hidden]] from you. The DC is reduced to DC 3 flat{9} instead of 11 against a hidden one.

When you cast shooting star and target a hidden creature, you don't have to attempt the flat check for targeting a hidden creature with a ranged Strike.
