# Airy Step
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** A creature targets you with an attack or other targeted effect, and you can see the attacker.

* * *

You create a blanket of fog in a 5 foot burst centered on one corner of your space. All creatures within that area are [[Concealed]], and all others are concealed to them. This concealment applies to the triggering effect, and the fog lasts for 1 minute or until dispersed by a strong wind. After resolving the triggering effect, you Step. If an effect prevents you from Stepping, you attempt to [[Escape]] the effect and Step if you succeed.
