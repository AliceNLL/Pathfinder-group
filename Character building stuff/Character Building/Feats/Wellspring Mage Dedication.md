# Wellspring Mage Dedication
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

There's no longer a limit on how many temporary spell slots you can gain per day from wellspring magic.

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you gain two other feats from the [[Wellspring Mage (Class Archetype)|Wellspring Mage]] archetype.
