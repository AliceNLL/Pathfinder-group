# Breath of Calamity
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your roar shakes the earth and splits the heavens. Once per day, you can cast _[[Chain Lightning]]_ as a 7th-level innate occult spell. Any creature that critically fails its save against the spell is [[Blinded]] and [[Deafened]] for 1 round.
