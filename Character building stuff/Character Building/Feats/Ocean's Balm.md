# Ocean's Balm
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

A blessing of the living sea salves wounds and douses flames. Touch a willing living creature. It regains 1d8 HP and gains resistance 2 to fire for 1 minute. If it has persistent fire damage, it can attempt a flat check to remove it with especially appropriate help. The target is temporarily immune to healing from Ocean's Balm for 10 minutes.

* * *

**Level (+2)** The healing increases by 1d8, and the resistance increases by 1.
