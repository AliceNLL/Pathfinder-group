# I Meant to do That
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Frequency** once per hour

**Requirements** Your previous action was a ranged weapon Strike that missed a foe within 60 feet.

* * *

Somehow your stray bullet causes an unintended reaction that creates a problem for your enemy: perhaps a ricochet knocks your foe's weapon away or they stumble over stray debris in an attempt to dodge your bullets. Roll a Deception check to attempt to [[Shove]], [[Trip]], or [[Disarm]] the foe you missed.
