# Eternal Composition
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

The world is a stage upon which you are always playing. You are permanently [[Quickened]]; you can use your extra action only to cast a composition cantrip that requires 1 action to cast. While in exploration mode, you can declare that you are performing an eligible composition cantrip while using any exploration tactic. Even before your first turn in a combat encounter, that cantrip is active as if you had cast it on your previous turn.
