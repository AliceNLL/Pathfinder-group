**Frequency** once per day

With effort, you can call forth magical wings from your back, similar in appearance to those of your extraplanar forebear, whether they be elegantly feathered wings or ominous bat wings. These wings remain for 10 minutes. You gain a fly Speed equal to your Speed while you've manifested your wings.
