# Bullet Dancer Reload
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** You're in Bullet Dancer Stance.

* * *

You've learned to reload your simple firearms with uncanny grace, the ammunition simply falling into place as though part of a well-practiced kata. You Strike with a simple firearm, and then Interact to reload that same firearm. You don't need a free hand to reload your simple firearm in this way.
