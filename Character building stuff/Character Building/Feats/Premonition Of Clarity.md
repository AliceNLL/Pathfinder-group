# Premonition Of Clarity
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Frequency** once per hour

**Trigger** You fail a saving throw against a mental effect.

* * *

Your deity sends you a vision of faith to steel you against mental attacks. Reroll the triggering saving throw with a +2 circumstance bonus. You must use the second result, even if it's worse.
