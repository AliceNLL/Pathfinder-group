# Web Walker
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You have plenty of practice navigating webs. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saves and AC against the _[[Web]]_ spell, natural webbing, and effects that entrap you in webbing, as well as a +1 circumstance bonus against other effects that snare and entangle you, like the _[[Entangling Flora]]_ spell. Whenever you roll a success on a saving throw against an effect involving a web, you get a critical success instead.
