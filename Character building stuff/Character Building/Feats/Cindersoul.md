# Cindersoul
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

The fire of your elemental ancestor manifests like dying embers of a blaze, and your inner charcoal helps staunch bleeding, purify simple poisons, and absorb acid. The DC for you to recover from persistent acid, bleed, and poison damage is 10 instead of 15 (or DC 5 flat if you have particularly effective assistance).
