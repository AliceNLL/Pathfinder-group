# Reflect Foe
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You create a copy of a foe by calling them forth from a nearby reflection, clonally growing them in an instant from one of your hairs or otherwise creating them in a way that matches your own nature as a reflection. You can cast _[[Duplicate Foe]]_ once per day as an innate occult spell. At 20th level, your innate _duplicate foe_ is heightened to 8th level.
