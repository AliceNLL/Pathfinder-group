# Turn the Wheel of Seasons
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

The seasons shift rapidly. This impulse affects a cube 100 feet in each dimension within 1,000 feet. Choose the starting season. The impulse lasts for 4 rounds, proceeding to the next season at the start of each of your turns. You can't use this impulse again until the previous one ends.

**Spring** Each ally in the cube gains 20 temporary HP that last until the start of your next turn. Any dying ally rolls a recovery check, but can't get worse than a success.

**Summer** (light) Each enemy in the area is exposed to sunlight and must attempt a DC resolve reflex save against your class DC. It's unaffected on a critical success, [[Dazzled]] until the start of your next turn on a success, or [[Blinded]] until the start of your next turn on a failure.

**Autumn** Leaves and rain make everything in the area [[Concealed]] until the start of your next turn, and a cold wind makes each enemy in the area [[Slowed]] until the start of your next turn unless it succeeds at a DC resolve fortitude save against your class DC.

**Winter** Each enemy in the aura takes 5d6 cold damage with a DC resolve reflex save against your class DC. A creature that fails its save also takes 2d6 persistent,cold damage.
