# Distracting Performance
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your performances are especially distracting, allowing your allies to sneak away with ease.

When you [[Aid]] an ally who is trying to [[Create a Diversion]], instead of the usual effects of Aid, you can roll a Performance check and use that result to determine the outcome of the diversion, instead of the ally rolling a Deception check.
