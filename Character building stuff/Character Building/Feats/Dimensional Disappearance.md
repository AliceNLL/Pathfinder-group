# Dimensional Disappearance
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You take advantage of teleportation to better hide your position. When you cast _[[Dimensional Assault]]_, you're affected by an _[[Invisibility]]_ spell at the end of the teleport.

You can choose not to make the Strike that is normally part of _dimensional assault_. If you do make the Strike, your _invisibility_ ends after the Strike, as normal for _invisibility_.
