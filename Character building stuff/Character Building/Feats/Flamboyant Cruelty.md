# Flamboyant Cruelty
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You love to kick your enemies when they're down, and you look fabulous when you do.

When you make a melee weapon Strike against a foe that has at least two of the following conditions, you gain a circumstance bonus to your damage roll equal to the number of these conditions the foe has.

The qualifying conditions are [[Clumsy 1|Clumsy]], [[Drained 1|Drained]], [[Enfeebled 1|Enfeebled]], [[Frightened]], [[Sickened 1|Sickened]], and [[Stupefied]].

If you hit such a foe, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to skill checks to [[Tumble Through]] and to perform your style's Panache-granting actions until the end of your turn.
