# Nocturnal Grippli
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You tend to do most of your hunting and work at night and have adapted to the requirements of nocturnal life. You gain [[Darkvision]], allowing you to see in darkness and dim light just as well as you can in bright light. However, in darkness, you see in black and white only.
