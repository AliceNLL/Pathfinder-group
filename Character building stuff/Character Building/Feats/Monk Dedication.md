![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You become trained in unarmed attacks and gain the [[Powerful Fist]] class feature. You become trained in your choice of Acrobatics or Athletics; if you are already trained in both of these skills, you become trained in a skill of your choice. You become trained in monk class DC.

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the [[Monk]] archetype.
