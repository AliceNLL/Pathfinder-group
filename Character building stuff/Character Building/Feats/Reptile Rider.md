# Reptile Rider
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

To you, crocodilians, giant lizards, and dinosaurs are loyal steeds, not monsters. You gain the [[Ride]] feat, even if you don't meet the prerequisites. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Nature checks to Handle an Animal as long as the animal is a reptile, dinosaur, or even a non-sapient dragon.

_**Note** This feat refers to Nature checks to Handle an Animal. This check does not exist in Pathfinder 2, and so the feat instead gives a bonus to Nature checks to [[Command an Animal]]._
