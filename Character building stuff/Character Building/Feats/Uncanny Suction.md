Your limbs produce strange, sucker-like growths that allow you to adhere to walls, objects, and most other surfaces. You gain a [[Climb]] Speed equal to your half your land Speed (minimum 5 feet). If you have the [[Quick Climb]] feat, your climb Speed is equal to your land Speed. In addition, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your Reflex DC to avoid being [[Disarm|Disarmed]].
