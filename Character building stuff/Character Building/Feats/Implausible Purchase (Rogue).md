# Implausible Purchase (Rogue)
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You can use [[Prescient Planner]] even if you have already used it after purchasing goods, and you can Interact to draw the item as a single action instead of a 2-action activity. In addition, five times per day, you can use Prescient Planner to pull out a common consumable item up to 6 levels lower than your level.
