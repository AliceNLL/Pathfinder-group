# Ebb And Flow
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You can pull forth both vitality and the void simultaneously to harm your enemies and heal your allies. If your next action is to cast a 1-action or 2-action [[Heal]] or [[Harm]] spell, choose one creature in range that would be harmed by the spell, and choose another creature within range that would be healed by the spell. Your _heal_ or _harm_ targets both creatures.
