# Split Hex
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You siphon some of the power from an offensive hex you cast to direct it at a second target as well. If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell to cast a harmful hex with a single target, reduce its rank by 2 (making it 2 ranks lower than the maximum spell rank you can cast). If you do, you can select a second target for that hex to affect.
