# Knowledge is Power
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

When you critically succeed at a Recall Knowledge check about a creature, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your next attack roll against the creature, to your AC against its next attack roll, and to your save against its next effect requiring a save.

If you share this information with your allies, they gain the benefits as well. If not used, these bonuses end after 1 minute.
