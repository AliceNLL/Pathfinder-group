# Roll With it (Kingmaker)
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** Your hunted prey, which must be a giant, hits you with a melee attack.

* * *

You can dodge attacks from giants. Attempt a Reflex save using 10 + the giant's attack bonus as the save DC. If the result allows you to Stride as part of the reaction, you may instead Fly or Swim if you have the corresponding movement type.

* * *

**Critical Success** The attack misses you (or if the attack was a critical hit, it becomes a regular hit). You can Stride up to 10 feet as part of the reaction; if you do so, the reaction gains the move trait.

**Success** The attack deals half damage. You can Stride up to 5 feet as part of the reaction, but you must end this movement adjacent to the triggering giant. If you do so, the reaction gains the move trait.

**Critical Failure** You fail to avoid the attack and are knocked [[Prone]] by the blow.
