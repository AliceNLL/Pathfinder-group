# Close Quarters
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You've trained to fight with allies in tunnel warrens, dense undergrowth, or similarly cramped terrain. If you are Small or smaller, you can end your movement in the same square as a Small or smaller ally. No more than two creatures can share the same space when using this ability or a similar one.
