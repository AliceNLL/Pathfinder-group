# Winter's Clutch
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Gleaming flakes of chilling snow fall in a 10-Foot Burst within 60 feet. Each creature in the area takes 2d4 cold damage with a DC 0 Basic Reflex save against your class DC. The ground in the area is covered in a snow drift, which is difficult terrain. Each square of the drift lasts until it melts, either naturally or until fire damage is dealt in that square.

* * *

**Level (+2)** The damage increases by 1d4.
