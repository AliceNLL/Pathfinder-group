# Alchemist Dedication
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You put your alchemical interest into practice. You become trained in alchemical bombs and Crafting; if you were already trained in Crafting, you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You become trained in alchemist class DC. You gain the alchemist's [[Infused Reagents]] class feature, gaining a number of reagents each day equal to your level. You also gain the [[Alchemical Crafting]] feat and four additional formulas for 1st-level alchemical items, as well as the ability to create free items during your daily preparations. Your advanced alchemy level is 1 and doesn't increase on its own.

**Special** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the [[Alchemist]] archetype.
