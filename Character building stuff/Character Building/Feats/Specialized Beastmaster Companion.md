# Specialized Beastmaster Companion
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your nimble and savage animal companions become cunning enough to become specialized. Each companion gains one specialization of your choice (_Core Rulebook_ 217, choose separately).

**Special** You can select this feat more than once. Each time, add a different specialization to your nimble and savage companions. Your nimble and savage companions can have up to three specializations each.
