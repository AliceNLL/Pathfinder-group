# Bless Shield
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your uttered prayers become an aegis, drawing the blessing of your deity across the surface of your shield. Until the beginning of your next turn your shield, any shield boss, or shield spikes gain the effects of a ghost touch property rune. Additionally, damage you take as a result of an incorporeal creature's Strike can trigger your Shield Block reaction, even if the damage isn't physical damage.
