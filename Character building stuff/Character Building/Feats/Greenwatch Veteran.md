# Greenwatch Veteran
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** Your turn starts, and you're in combat against a creature you spent at least 10 minutes [[Track|Tracking]].

* * *

Your time spent tracking your target allows you to quickly identify its weaknesses and relay them to your allies. Attempt a Recall Knowledge check against the creature you were [[Track|Tracking]]. On a success, you always know the creature's greatest weakness and highest resistance or immunity, in addition to any other information the check would typically provide. You immediately use a quick series of hand gestures to signal this information to any allies who can see you.
