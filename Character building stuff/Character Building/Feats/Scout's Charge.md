# Scout's Charge
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You meander around unpredictably, and then ambush your opponents without warning.

Choose one enemy. Stride, [[Feint]] against that opponent, and then make a Strike against that foe. For your Feint, you can attempt a Stealth check instead of the Deception check that's usually required, because you use the terrain around you to catch your foe off-guard.
