# Call And Response
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your composition takes the form of a call-and-response chant that lets your allies continue the effect without you. If your next action is to cast a composition cantrip with a duration of 1 round, it becomes a call. While the spell is active, one ally of your choice affected by the spell can respond to your call as a single action that has the auditory and concentrate traits to extend the spell's duration by 1 round. Only one ally can respond to a given call, and responding to the ally's response has no additional effect.
