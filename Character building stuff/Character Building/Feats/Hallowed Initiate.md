# Hallowed Initiate
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You've expanded your focus spellcasting to techniques used by clerics and wizards. You gain an additional focus spell, either the necromancer school spell _[[Call of the Grave]]_ or the initial domain spell of the death domain, _[[Death's Call]]_. Increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1.

**Special** You can select this feat a second time, choosing the other initial focus spell.
