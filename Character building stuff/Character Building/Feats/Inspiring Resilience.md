# Inspiring Resilience
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Trigger** You and at least one other creature become the target of a spell or effect with the emotion, fear, or mental trait that allows a saving throw, and you haven't rolled the save yet.

* * *

You show defiance in times of hardship and inspire your companions to persevere. Allies within 30 feet of you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to their Will save against the triggering effect, or a +2 circumstance bonus if the effect originated from an undead.
