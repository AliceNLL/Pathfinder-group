Your presence has a bolstering effect on your undead minions. Undead creatures under your control and within a 30 foot emanation around you gain a +2 status bonus to saving throws to resist vitality damage and to Will saving throws to resist effects that would make them controlled.

**Special** This feat has the trait matching your spellcasting tradition.
