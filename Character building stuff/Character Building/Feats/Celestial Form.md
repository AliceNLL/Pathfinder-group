# Celestial Form
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You take on a celestial countenance, appearing like a type of celestial who serves your deity; for example, as an angel, you would gain a halo and feathery wings.

You gain a fly Speed equal to your Speed. You gain [[Darkvision]] if you don't already have it, and you gain the celestial trait and the trait appropriate to the type of servitor you've become (archon, angel, or azata, for example).
