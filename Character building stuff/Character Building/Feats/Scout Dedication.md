# Scout Dedication
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You are a highly skilled scout, capable of providing your allies a timely warning of any danger. You gain the [[Scout's Warning]] ranger feat.

When you're using the [[Scout]] exploration activity, you grant your allies a +2 circumstance bonus to their initiative rolls instead of a +1 circumstance bonus.

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the [[Scout]] archetype.
