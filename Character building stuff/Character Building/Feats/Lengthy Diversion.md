# Lengthy Diversion
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

When you critically succeed to [[Create a Diversion]], you continue to remain [[Hidden]] after the end of your turn. This effect lasts for an amount of time that depends on the diversion and situation, as determined by the GM (minimum 1 additional round).
