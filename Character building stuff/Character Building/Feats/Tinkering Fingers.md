You're good with your hands and can quickly improvise a fix for broken or damaged equipment. You're trained in Crafting. If you would automatically become trained in Crafting (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You can [[Repair]] an item without using a repair kit without taking the -2 circumstance penalty, improvising tools from whatever you have at hand.
