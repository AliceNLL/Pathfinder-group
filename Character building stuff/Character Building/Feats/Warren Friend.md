You're adept at making contact with other ysoki. When you arrive at a new settlement, you automatically find the nearest ratfolk enclave by spending 1 day of downtime searching, provided one exists and its members aren't actively hiding from you. Once you've made contact, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Gather Information and Earn Income in the settlement.
