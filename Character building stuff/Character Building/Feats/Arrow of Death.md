# Arrow of Death
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

You modify an arrow or bolt to bring death to your target in a single potent hit. Make a bow Strike. On a hit, you deal an additional 10d10 precision damage. On a critical hit, the target must also succeed at a DC resolve fortitude saving throw against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher, or be immediately slain; this save has the death and incapacitation traits.
