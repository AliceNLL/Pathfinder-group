# Iruxi Glide
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You glide slowly toward the ground, 5 feet down and up to 25 feet forward through the air. As long as you spend at least 1 action gliding each round and haven't yet reached the ground, you remain in the air at the end of your turn.
