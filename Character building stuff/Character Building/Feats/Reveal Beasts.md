# Reveal Beasts
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You are adept at revealing—or creating—weaknesses among those who are a threat to civilization. If you roll a success on a check to Recall Knowledge to identify an animal or a beast, you get a critical success instead. The next time you damage that creature, it gains weakness 5 during that attack to one damage type of your choice that you dealt it.
