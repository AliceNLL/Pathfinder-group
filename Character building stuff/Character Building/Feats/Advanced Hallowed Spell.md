# Advanced Hallowed Spell
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You dig deeper into the magical tools found in wizard schools and divine domains. You gain an advanced focus spell, either the necromancer advanced school spell _[[Life Siphon]]_ or the advanced domain spell of the death domain, _[[Eradicate Undeath]]_. Increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1. If you choose _life siphon_, it triggers when you expend spell slots from your class even if they aren't wizard spell slots.

**Special** You can select this feat a second time, choosing the other advanced focus spell.
