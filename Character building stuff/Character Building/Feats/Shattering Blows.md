# Shattering Blows
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your forceful blows shatter objects with ease. While you are raging, your melee [[Strike|Strikes]] ignore 5 points of an object's Hardness. If you have the [[Devastator]] class feature, you instead ignore 10 points of an object's Hardness.
