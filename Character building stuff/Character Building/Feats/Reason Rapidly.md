# Reason Rapidly
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your mind works through clues at an unbelievable speed. You instantly use up to five [[Recall Knowledge]] actions. If you have any special abilities or free actions that would normally be triggered when you Recall Knowledge, you can't use them for these actions.
