# Terrifying Countenance
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You can erect a magical cowl that terrorizes your enemies. Once per day, you can cast _[[Mask of Terror]]_ as an innate occult spell, targeting yourself. If you critically hit a creature that's temporarily immune to the spell, the creature's temporary immunity ends.
