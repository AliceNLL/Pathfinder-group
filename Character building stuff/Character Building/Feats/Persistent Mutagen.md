![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You've trained your physical form to remain stable within the a given altered state. Once per day, when you consume an alchemical item with the infused and mutagen traits, you can retain its effects until the next time you make your daily preparations instead of its normal duration.
