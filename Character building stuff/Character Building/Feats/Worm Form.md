# Worm Form
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You take on the form of a purple worm or transform into a humanoid-worm hybrid, retaining your own head but with a worm's body, transforming into a Huge battle form. You must have enough space to expand into or the ability is lost. While in this form, you gain the animal trait. You can Dismiss the form.

You gain the following statistics and abilities regardless of which battle form you choose:

*   AC = 20 + your level. Ignore your armor's check penalty and Speed reduction.
*   40 temporary Hit Points.
*   Darkvision.
*   One or more unarmed melee attacks specific to the battle form you choose, which are the only attacks you can Strike with. You're trained with them. Your attack modifier is +25, and you use the listed damage. Melee attacks are Strength based (for the purpose of the enfeebled condition, for example). If your unarmed attack modifier is higher, you can use it instead.
*   Athletics modifier of +30, unless your own modifier is higher.

You also gain specific abilities based on the type of monster you choose:

**Purple Worm** Speed 40 feet, burrow 30 feet, swim 20 feet

**Melee** 1 jaws (deadly 2d10, reach 15 feet), **Damage** 3d10+15 piercing

**Melee**1 stinger (agile, poison, reach 15 feet), **Damage** 2d12+15 piercing plus 2d6 persistent poison

**Melee**1 body (reach 15 feet) **Damage** 1d10+13 bludgeoning

**Hybrid** Speed 40 feet

**Melee**1 stinger (agile, poison, reach 10 feet), **Damage** 2d12+15 piercing plus 1d6 persistent poison

**Melee**1 body (reach 10 feet), **Damage** 1d10+13 bludgeoning

**Hybrid Caster** You retain the ability to speak, and can cast spells as long as they don't have somatic or material components.
