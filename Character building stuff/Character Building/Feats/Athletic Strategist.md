# Athletic Strategist
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You know how to calculatedly manipulate joints and body weight. In addition to using [[Devise a Stratagem|Devise a Strategem]] to modify a Strike, you can use it to modify a [[Disarm]], [[Grapple]], [[Shove]], or [[Trip]] attempt, substituting your Devise a Stratagem roll for the Athletics check. You must apply the substitution to the first eligible attack you make, whether it's a Strike or one of the Athletics actions.

You can also use your Intelligence modifier instead of Strength for the Athletics check when you substitute your Devise a Stratagem roll, unless you're using a weapon for the maneuver and the weapon doesn't fit the restrictions for using Intelligence with a stratagem.
