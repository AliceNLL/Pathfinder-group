# Smoldering Explosion
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

When you cast fireball heightened to at least 4th level, you can modify the spell to add the following to its standard effects: Your fireball leaves behind a brief cloud of smoke in its area. While it's smoke instead of mist, this cloud otherwise has the effects of obscuring mist, except that it lasts only 1 round.
