# Oneiric Influence
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

While Infiltrating a Dream, you can also implant a suggestion in the target's mind. The target must attempt a DC resolve will save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher, to resist your modification, which has the effects of a _[[Subconscious Suggestion]]_ spell, but even on a critical success, the target doesn't realize you were trying to control them and may not recognize your presence in the dream. The suggestion remains in the target's subconscious for 1 week or until triggered. Their memories of carrying out the suggestion are hazy and dreamlike and they may not remember doing it unless later reminded.
