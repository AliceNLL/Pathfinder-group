# Superior Sight
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your senses are peerless. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks, and you gain low-light vision. If you already have low-light vision, gain darkvision instead. Furthermore, when you target an enemy, you automatically succeed at the flat check if that enemy is concealed, hidden, or undetected.

_Note: this version of the feat does not modify vision. See [[Superior Sight (Darkvision)]] or [[Superior Sight (Low-Light Vision)]] if you need the feature to also grant you a new sense._
