# Arcane Safeguards
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

The magic powering you makes it difficult for outside magic to affect you. You gain the [[Resist Magic]] reaction.

**Enhancement** Your safeguards improve. When you Resist Magic, you gain a number of temporary Hit Points equal to the spell level of the triggering effect.
