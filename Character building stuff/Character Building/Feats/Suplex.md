# Suplex
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** You have a creature [[Grabbed]] or [[Restrained]].

* * *

Flexing your entire body, you heave your opponent over your head and slam them into the ground. Make an unarmed melee Strike against the creature you have grabbed or restrained; on a success, the target lands [[Prone]], and on a critical success, the target lands prone and takes an additional 2d6 bludgeoning damage. Regardless of whether the Strike is successful, you immediately release your hold on the target.
