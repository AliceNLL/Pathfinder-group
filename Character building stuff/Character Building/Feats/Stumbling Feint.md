# Stumbling Feint
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Requirements** You are in [[Stumbling Stance]].

* * *

You lash out confusingly with what seems to be a weak move but instead allows you to unleash a dangerous flurry of blows upon your unsuspecting foe.

When you use [[Flurry of Blows]], you can attempt a check to [[Feint]] as a free action just before the first Strike.

On a success, instead of making the target [[Off-Guard]] against your next attack, they become off-guard against both attacks from the Flurry of Blows.
