# Bloody Blows
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your lethal unarmed attacks leave bloody gouges or cause severe internal bleeding. When you critically hit with a Strike using an unarmed attack that isn't nonlethal, the target takes 1d4 persistent bleed damage. This can be because you're taking the penalty to use a fist for a lethal attack or because you have an unarmed attack without the nonlethal trait due to [[Tusks (Orc)|Tusks]] or a similar ability.
