# Lion Blade Dedication
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Access** You are from Taldor.

* * *

Your lion blade spy training helps you conceal yourself and your identity. You become trained in your choice of Deception or Stealth and in Espionage Lore; if you were already trained, you become an expert instead. You never take circumstance penalties for attempting to take a disguise of a different ancestry, age, and so on, as long as the disguised form is appropriate for your size.

* * *

**Special** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the [[Lion Blade]] archetype.
