# Gladiator Dedication
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You know how to turn combat into a form of entertainment. You become trained in Gladiatorial Lore; if already trained in Gladiatorial Lore, you instead become trained in another Lore skill of your choice.

At the start of a combat encounter, if you have spectators, you gain a number of temporary HP equal to your character level for 1 minute and you can roll Performance for your initiative.

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the [[Gladiator]] archetype.
