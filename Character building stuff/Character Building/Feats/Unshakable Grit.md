# Unshakable Grit
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You've become hardened by conflict after everything you've faced, and you possess a certain intractable stubbornness. If the reroll granted to you by your Grit and Tenacity reaction is a success, you get a critical success instead; if it's a critical failure, you get a failure instead.
