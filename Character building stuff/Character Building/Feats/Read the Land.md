# Read the Land
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You've learned how to commune with the land to learn information. You learn the _[[Commune]]_ ritual if you didn't know it already. You can perform this ritual with a casting time of 1 hour instead of 1 day and without a secondary caster.
