# Knight Reclaimant Dedication
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You have sworn the Crimson Oath and become a full member of the Crimson Reclaimers. You gain expert proficiency in Stealth and Survival. Whenever you roll a success on a saving throw against an undead's special ability, you get a critical success instead. This applies to any abilities that come from being undead, including an undead's innate spells (but not its prepared or spontaneous spells).

**Special** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the [[Knight Reclaimant]] archetype.
