# Seeker Arrow
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your shots zip around corners and fly at impossible angles to reach your target. Make a bow Strike against a foe you can see; the ammunition travels to your target, even around corners. You ignore the target's [[Concealed]] condition and all cover.
