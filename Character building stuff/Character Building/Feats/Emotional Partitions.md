# Emotional Partitions
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You have created strong mental partitions in your mind to filter out negative emotional influences. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus on saving throws against emotion effects. If you roll a success on a saving throw against an emotion effect, you get a critical success instead.
