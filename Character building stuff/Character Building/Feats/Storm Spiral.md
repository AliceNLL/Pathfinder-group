# Storm Spiral
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Dark thunderclouds swirl in a miniature storm, crisscrossed with lightning bolts; a tremendous thunderclap fills the air. The storm appears in a 20 foot burst within 60 feet. Each creature in the area takes 3d12 electricity + 1d10 sonic damage, with a DC resolve reflex save against your class DC. A creature that fails its save is [[Deafened]] until the end of its next turn (or for 1 minute on a critical failure). A creature wearing metal armor or made of metal takes a -1 circumstance penalty to its save.

* * *

**Level (+3)** The electricity damage increases by 1d12.
