# Breath of Hungry Death
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

**Frequency** Once per hour

* * *

You have uncovered occult mysteries that allow you to unleash the devastating hunger of Kabriri upon your foes with a single exhalation, releasing a massive cloud of flesh-eating gas that glows with a sickly green light. You deal 7d6 acid, 7d6 void{7d6 acid and 7d6 void damage} to all creatures within a 30 foot cone (DC resolve reflex save with a DC equal to your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher). A creature that gets a critical failure on this Reflex save is also [[Paralyzed]] for 1 round. A creature that succeeds at this save becomes temporarily immune to Breath of Hungry Death for 24 hours.

When a creature is killed using Breath of Hungry Death, its body is reduced to a smoldering pile of ash wafting with necrotic fumes. You can use a reaction to immediately inhale these fumes and become satiated or fully satiated as if you had used Consume Flesh.
