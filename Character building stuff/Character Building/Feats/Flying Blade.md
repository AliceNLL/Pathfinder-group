# Flying Blade
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You've learned to apply your flashy techniques to thrown weapons as easily as melee attacks.

When you have [[Panache]], you apply your [[Precise Strike]] damage on ranged Strikes you make with a thrown weapon within that weapon's first range increment. The thrown weapon must be an agile or finesse weapon.

This also allows you to make a thrown weapon ranged Strike for [[Confident Finisher]] and any other finisher that includes a Strike that can benefit from your precise strike.
