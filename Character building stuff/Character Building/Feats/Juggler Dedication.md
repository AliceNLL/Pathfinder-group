# Juggler Dedication
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You become trained in Performance; if you were already trained in Performance, you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also gain the [[Juggle]] skill feat, even if you don't meet its prerequisites.

**Special** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained one other feat from the [[Juggler]] archetype.
