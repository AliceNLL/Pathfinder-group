# Greater Magical Scholastics
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You broaden your magical studies, allowing you to find the right path, detect objects, and conceal those objects from unscrupulous rivals.

You can cast _[[Augury]]_, _[[Locate]]_, and _[[Veil of Privacy]]_ as occult innate spells, each once per day. You can cast this _nondetection_ spell only on an object, and it is automatically heightened to the same spell level as your cantrips from Magical Scholastics.
