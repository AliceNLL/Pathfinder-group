# Ankle Biter
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You fight just as well on the ground as you do standing up. While you are [[Prone]], you are always [[Take Cover|Taking Cover]] against ranged attacks, you ignore the status penalty on your attack rolls from being prone, and you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Athletics checks to [[Trip]].

You can choose to move up to half your Speed when you [[Crawl]]. You can instead move up to your full Speed when you Crawl, but if you do, you must succeed at a DC 6 flat or your body deteriorates.
