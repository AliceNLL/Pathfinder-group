# Master of Apprentice
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Teaching is a difficult art form, but you've gotten a pretty good handle on it. When you [[Craft]] or [[Earn Income]] during downtime, you can also attempt to Aid another creature doing the same with the same skill if they have a lower proficiency bonus than you. If you succeed, they can use the better result between your check and their own check.
