# Repeating Hand Crossbow Training
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You become trained in the [[Repeating Hand Crossbow]] and gain access to repeating hand crossbows and [[Shootist Bandolier]]. Whenever you gain a class feature that grants you expert or greater proficiency in a given weapon or weapons, you also gain that proficiency in the repeating hand crossbow. If you're at least an expert in a repeating hand crossbow you're using, you gain access to its critical specialization effect. You can perform the [[Shootist's Draw]] action with repeating hand crossbows.

**Special** If you have the [[Running Reload]] feat, you can reload a [[Repeating Hand Crossbow Magazine]] on the move. You can use Running Reload as a 3-action activity to reload a magazine into a repeating hand crossbow after you Stride, Step, or Sneak, or as a 2-action activity if you use a magazine from a shootist bandolier.
