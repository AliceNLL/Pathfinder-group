# Shared Luck (Catfolk)
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

When you use [[Cat's Luck]] to reroll a Reflex saving throw, any creatures you choose within 10 feet who also just failed a Reflex saving throw against the same effect (such as a single spell) can also reroll their saving throws and use the better result.
