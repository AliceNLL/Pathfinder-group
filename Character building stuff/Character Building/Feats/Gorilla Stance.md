# Gorilla Stance
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You lower yourself to the ground and take an imposing, knuckle - walking stance.

While in this stance, the only Strikes you can make are gorilla slam unarmed attacks. These deal 1d8 bludgeoning damage; are in the brawling group; and have the backswing, forceful, grapple, nonlethal, and unarmed traits.

While you are in Gorilla Stance, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Athletics checks to [[Climb]], and if you roll a success on an Athletics check to Climb, you get a critical success instead.
