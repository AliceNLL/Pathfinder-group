# Spelunker
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Living underground, you have learned to find your way without landmarks or even solid ground. If you roll a success on an Survival check to [[Sense Direction]] or an Athletics check to [[Climb]], you get a critical success instead. You're not [[Off-Guard]] when you attempt to Climb.
