# Goblin Weapon Expertise
![[icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Your goblin affinity blends with your class training, granting you great skill with goblin weapons. Whenever you gain a class feature that grants you expert or greater proficiency in a given weapon or weapons, you also gain that proficiency in the dogslicer, horsechopper, and all goblin weapons in which you are trained.
