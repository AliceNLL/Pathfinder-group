==Unique== ==Evocation== ==Magical==


**Usage** held in 2 hands; **Bulk** 2
**Base Weapon** Jezail

---

This _+1 striking [jezail](https://2e.aonprd.com/Weapons.aspx?ID=203)_ is built from white hot metal and has a ruby fused into the palm wood stock. When the _iris of the sky_ misfires, you take 5 [persistent fire damage](https://2e.aonprd.com/Conditions.aspx?ID=29).  


The first firearm of this type came as the result of a gunslinger who entreated an [efreeti](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=214), wishing for the might of the desert sun. The weapon constantly glows and burns with a brilliant intensity. The firearm has since belonged to an extensive string of users and been replicated several times, though each wielder of the weapon, whether the original or one of its copies, has eventually ended up as a charred husk, slain by fire in battle or unusual accidents that no one could quite explain except, perhaps, the efreet.

---

**Activate** `[one-action]` envision; **Frequency** once per minute; **Effect** You focus the solar energy housed in the ruby to release a gout of solar flame instead of a bullet. Make a Strike with the _iris of the sky_. All damage from this Strike is fire damage and the target takes an additional 1d6 fire damage and 1d6 persistent fire damage.  
  
**Activate** `[two-actions]` command, envision ([fortune](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=76)); **Frequency** once per minute; **Effect** You make a wish into the _iris of the sky_, yearning for it to strike true, and then fire. Strike against a foe with the iris, rolling the attack roll twice and taking the better result. If the attack is a failure, you take 5 persistent fire damage.

[**_PFS Note_**](https://2e.aonprd.com/PFS.aspx) _Gunslingers (and characters with the Gunslinger archetype) gain access to all uncommon weapons, ammunition, and related items from Chapter 4 of this book, with the exception of Beast Guns and any limited or restricted items, unless the item indicates otherwise. Characters with a Home Region of Alkenstar, Dongun Hold, or the Shackles have access to all black powder guns, ammunition and related accessories._  


  
**Access** The following regions have access to firearms: Alkenstar, Dongun Hold, Tian Xia, Vudra, Arcadia, Ustalav, the Shackles  
**Price** 6 gp; **Damage** 1d4 P; **Bulk** 1  
**Hands** 1; **Range** 40 ft.; **Reload** 1  
**Type** Ranged; **Category** Simple; **Group** [Firearm](https://2e.aonprd.com/WeaponGroups.aspx?ID=16)  
**Ammunition** [Firearm Ammunition (10 rounds)](https://2e.aonprd.com/Weapons.aspx?ID=211)

Though less accurate and powerful than a [flintlock musket](https://2e.aonprd.com/Weapons.aspx?ID=191), the flintlock pistol is a preferred weapon of privateers thanks to its more compact size and affordability. Pirate captains often wear a brace of such pistols in a bandolier so they can draw and fire without stopping to reload.

---

**Concussive:**

These weapons smash as much as puncture. When determining a creature's resistance or immunity to damage from this weapon, use the weaker of the target's resistance or immunity to piercing or to bludgeoning. For instance, if the creature were immune to piercing and had no resistance or immunity to bludgeoning damage, it would take full damage from a concussive weapon. Resistance or immunity to all physical damage, or all damage, applies as normal.

**Fatal d8:**

The fatal trait includes a die size. On a critical hit, the weapon’s damage die increases to that die size instead of the normal die size, and the weapon adds one additional damage die of the listed size.

**Uncommon:**

Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of [Recall Knowledge](https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=26) checks related to these creature is increased by 2.
